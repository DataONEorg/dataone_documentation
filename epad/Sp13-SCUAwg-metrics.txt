Spring 2014

Usability WG – report out for CCIT discussion Metrics, Performance Measures  --Denise

Outcomes measure options – will consider opportunities (scientist conferences, DUG, etc.)
Remaining issues: 
   * output measures  -- plenty of data points from CCIT group
     * NSF requirements (primary focus):
       * Unique users
       * Queries only
       * Advanced search
       * Investigator Tool kit software use
       * Number of users who access data that also produce derived data products that are deposited in MN repositories (perception that Provenance group will address)
     * Concept of successful searches discussed – requires surveying the user – Dave/Matt and CCIT group will investigate options to satisfy this request
     *  
   * performance measures 
     * recommend restricting to network performance and site / tool usability
     * network performance metrics can be derived from the CCIT work
     * site and tool usability requires user assessment
       * eye tracking, etc
       * level of confidence with tools (pre/post training (in person or webinars); pre/post education tool use (online or in person))?
       * Use/reuse of site; data deposit – levels of engagement (requires user interview/survey because data mining doesn’t get at specific IP ranges)
