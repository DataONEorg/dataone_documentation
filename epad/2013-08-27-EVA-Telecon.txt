2.  Vis Techniques -- Aritra 


   * One  part of this activity was to collect figures (maps, scatter plots, bar  charts, line plots) from the literature, critique the effectiveness of these plots, and develop a set of categories for the effectiveness. 
     * Maps
       * matrix of 17 North American images of model outputs
         * show spatial extent of the models and show the many ways the models are different
         * not just range or mean, but the spatial patterns of lows and highs
         * other figures in the paper show slices of these images
         * aesthetics:  thick lines, outline of continent, background (green and purple (too close to the color bar)
           * lots of room for improvement in aesthetics
       * color choices (get rid of rainbow); different scales is a hindrance;  move units next to color bar, 
       * Maps have their own advantages, hard to replace
     * Scatter Plots
       * for Figure from Debbie's figure, use lines and give each "outlier" model a symbol to indicate which model 
         * need to define what an "outlier"
         * within a paper, it would be good to use a common format for each figure (always have GPP on top).  Having one different (cf. slide 7) then it may be hard to carry information from one slide to the next.
       * Ozone figure:  remove individual model points and retain just the line to remove clutter
         * but keep each individual observations
         * 
     * Line Charts

   * The  other part of this activity is to pick representative visualizations and develop alternative methods for visualizing the data.  
   * Ultimately the group will develop a set of best practices for visualizing complex data.

    Examples
