Agenda for 2012-08-24

1) CI Update (Vieglais)

CCIT meeting this week in Santa Barbara
Significant milestones coming up:
 * RSV  (no dates yet)
 * Proposal renewal

Checked metrics from PPM - in good shape for the most part
Would have 40 MNs by end of 5th year and 20 MNs at end of year 4 so this
would mean 1 per month and increasing to 2 per month
Have 55-60 potential MNs on the list; 
Identified someone who will get in touch with the potential MN
Also reviewed the MN process
Broad recognition that need management system for keeping track of MNs - Word document won't be sufficient
Need one person full time to deal with MN

Related to the 2 milestones above -
Need to focus on user-oriented aspects of the infrastructure - want users to have good experience and return
List of priorities:

- User facing capabilities
  - DataUp - beginning of its lifecycle (important but unknown because haven't seen source code)
  - ONEDrive
  - Morpho
  - R
  - Web interface - ONEMercury issues; no longer based on Mercury  functionality; may need to change name
  - XX Total Impact
  - XX Citation tools (e.g. zotero, mendeley)

(XX means could be dropped if don't have sufficient time or resources)

- Core operations
  - !! API changes - search
  - Replication (will run from 1 CN rather than all 3 CNs)
  - Synchronization 
  - Indexing
  - Log Aggregation
  - Member node deployments

- Dashboard
  - Counts of objects page for: DataSet, User, MN Level, Whole system
  - Log reporting

- XX DataNet integration

Framework for the EAB meeting in December
Does CCIT have usability testing results done at ESIP?  Not yet - just overview
Did discuss design features of a search

2) CE Update (Budden)
Organizing a workshop for Intecol 2013
Also with TerraPop
Coppus
Getting DUG and ESA materials on the web site
