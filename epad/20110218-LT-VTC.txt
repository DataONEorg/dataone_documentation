  Agenda for 2011-02-11

1. Presentations for the NSF Review
(https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/documents/management/nsf-reviews/nsf-review-february-2011/presentation-materials-for-nsf-review/current-working-copies-of-nsf-presentations-post-eab-review/)

Content Review (authors):
Graphic Review (Amber):
Last Review (spell check, etc - Rebecca):

Are Morpho and Kepler working parts of ITK?  Kepler not ready yet; Morpho will be demo'd but not fully integrated
Charge to Reviewers indicators: Either at the beginning or end of each talk indicate what
refers back to the charge
For CI section: one rather than one for each of the 3 sections
Bruce has redone CI overview including the specific wording of the charge to reviewers where appropriate.
Follow Winston Churchill approach

List of stakeholders needs to be finalized for multiple presentations (whether to include Archives or not).

Computers: Matt & Dave for CI, Bill for main presentation
At run throughs we'll make sure the presentations are on multiple computers

On Tuesday have computers checked out at NSF computing so won't need to do it on
Wednesday.

As soon Bill arrives, he'll let others know which room and we'll start the  practice presentations as soon as everyone arrives Tuesday evening.

2.  Status of CI demos for Review (Vieglais/Jones)

R-demo is working!  Working on screen casts now
3.  Seating plan for NSF Review- only 6 can be in the room at a time (Michener)

Dave will create an epad for the NSF Review and put some security in front of it.
It will be a good idea to list your cell phone numbers on that epad

Review Team:
Below  is the list of reviewers for the DataNet critical review.  Please be  reminded that you may not contact or communicate in any way members of  the panel.
Co Chairs:
Dan Lubin is it this lubin? http://www.sio.ucsd.edu/Profile/dlubin
Lillian (Boots) Cassel http://what.csc.villanova.edu/~cassel/
- She also seems to be interested in educational aspects

     
Panel:




Michael Huhns
Plato Smith transcript of 2009 interview  http://ohp.fsu.edu/webpdf/1963_Smith.pdf
Peter Fox
Julio Ibarra is this him? <http://ciara.fiu.edu/staff_julio.html>
Michael Piasecki
Jeanne Behnke
 
Just  as a FYI, during a conference with the Co-Chairs today,   They wanted  the teams to make sure that the items in the charge were clearly  identified to the panel in the materials and/or the presentations.
Final Agenda:
https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/documents/management/nsf-reviews/nsf-review-february-2011/DataNet%203%20day%20Agenda%20not%20Draft.pdf

Note from NSF:
Please  find attached the Agenda for the DataNet review(link above).  The panel and chairs   have seen the agenda and have not asked for any changes. The room numbers for each day are on the agenda. Both teams will be meeting in Stafford II room 595. The request for two computers, projection systems and screens has been accommodated and though the space will be a bit tight, I believe things are in order for us to be as comfortable as possible.
 
For the members of your teams that need to transition in and out of the room, NSF has no specifications on times or mechanism other than those members that need to wait may wait in the front part of room 505 of Stafford II. I do not think they would be comfortable there all day but   the room has comfortable seating and ready access to the meeting  room.  Fire codes require that they not be standing in the hallway outside the meeting room.  As long as everyone picks up badges in Stafford I before trying to gain access to Stafford II, there are no  specifications as to how you shift your team members throughout the  presentations.  
 **For those members outside of the meeting room, ABSOLUTELY NO CONVERSATION concerning any part of the review, team members, or panelists may take place**
 
 People leaving will be a signal to those who need to come in. NSF will probably want to stick to the schedule. Can set up early on Wednesday (7:30am) before the Sayeed response (30min).

4.  DUG Meeting in July  (Koskela)
ESIP will start at 1:00pm on Tuesday. Discussion that traveling on Saturday for a Sunday meeting not a good idea.  Best to plan a meeting that lasts 1.5 days with no breakout rooms.
Also not good to make people switch hotels. Will need to get invitations out after the review is over.

5. Around the Room 

Amber - Started developing the plan for the Education Modules Workshop with Viv and Kristin (UNM LTER).  Proposed dates: week of July 25th. 

Mike - Just one very minor suggestion, any references to NBII, I'd make sure you refer to USGS.  With recent FY2012 budget guidance, just makes more sense.  

Mike - It looks like Viv will have a conflict with the Best Practices workshop planning in early March.   Just in case she hasn't had a chance to send everyone a note...   

Suzie:  I did two invited talks in India both featuring DataONE activities. One regarding community engagement activities (International Conference on the Converfence of Libraries, Archives and Museums. Delhi) and the other regarding the virtual organization(International Conerence on Digital Libraries and Knowledge Organization, Gurgaon)

John: Perhaps intersting workshop where we may want to present EVA eBird results http://www.psc.edu/data-analytics/

Marratech Notes:


[11:26 AM] Dave:  http://epad.dataone.org/20110218-LT-VTC
[11:33 AM] John:   google has discovered epad.dataone.org

[12:01 PM] Mike:  I think that's the issue related to break outs
[12:01 PM] Mike:  I agree just make it work
[12:03 PM] Mike:  No problem, call my cell or e-mail me...
[12:04 PM] Suzie:  Another good way to reach me quickly is via text -- I can always ck that during meetings and leave to take care of business
