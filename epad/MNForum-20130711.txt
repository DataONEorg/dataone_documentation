Member Node Forum - 11 July 2013

There is no Member Node Forum this week - we will resume our regular bi-weekly schedule on 25 July.
In the meantime ---

if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to post them here or call/email John (865.576.5439, cobbjw@ornl.gov) or Laura (865.974.7931, lmoyers1@utk.edu).

If you attended the DUG meeting in Chapel Hill, tell us what you thought!  Were you able to find answers to your questions?  What  did you like about the DUG?  What would you change?
