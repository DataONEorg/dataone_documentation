DataONE Developer Call - 2011-01-05
===================================

:Attendees: Paul Allen, Dave Vieglais, Bob Sandusky, Roger Dahl, John Kunze, Mark Servilla, Jeff Horsburgh, Matt Jones, Rebecca Koskela, Ryan Scherle, Line Pouchard, Bruce Wilson, Rob Nahf, Ravi Vegiraju


Action Items:

- Schedule discussion for CiLogon page (Mark)
- Invitations to Integration and Semantics workshop for Mark Schildhauer and John K. (Line, Jeff)
- CCIT consider overall goals for IS working group and key deliverables over next couple of years (CCIT)
- Vote on vacation destination for July CCIT meeting (Dave send out note to CCIT)
- Moving forward with hardware purchase - question on preferred vendor vs. bid (Dave)
- Solicit input on Docs and presentations for Feb review (+ EAB) (Dave)
- Brief note about PASTA <-> DataONE (Mark)


Agenda and Notes
----------------

0. Comments on DataONE branded CILogon page (Mark)

- Take a look at: https://cilogon.org/?skin=DataONE

- Please provide Mark Servilla with feedback regarding the general appearance and usability from a DataONE end user perspective on this interface.

- Matt - suggest a bit more discussion - e.g. what to do with the certificate, etc. Lots of usability issues associated with handling certificates - web interface is probably fine, it's what to do with it afterwards.

- Mark will doodle poll for additional discussion

1. General update on CI

- update on bugs and issues surrounding identifier encoding
- update on general progress
    -- about to embark on MN replication for Metacat, largely complete for GMN, needs work on the CN side
    -- starting work on Authorization implementation
        http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/Authorization.html
        -- feedback requested ASAP
    -- will be starting to focus on ITK demos for site review

2. Preparations for the EAB (Jan 17-18) and NSF Review (Feb 22-24)

A. Documents

- Define cyberinfrastructure
- Design, reference architecture diagrams
- Software development and implementation timeline
- Goals of the DataNet program as implemented by DataONE infrastructure
  
  - Curation and preservation
  - Search and discovery
  - Security
  - Integration with investigator tools

- Technical collaborations

B. Presentations

C. Demonstrations

From http://epad.dataone.org/20101110-CCIT-VTC :

 * 1. Target deliverables for the February review
 * 
 *   i. Infrastructure functionality
 * 
 *     - Add content to a member node
 *     - Synchronize coordinating node catalog with member node content
 *     - Discover newly added content
 *     - Retrieve new content from original member node
 *     - Replicate content to another member node
 *     - Resolve the location of the content
 *     - Retrieve content with original member node offline
 *     - Authenticate using CILogon
 * 
 *   ii. infrastructure deployment
 *   
 *     - Three coordinating nodes (UNM, UCSB, ORC)
 *     - KNB member node (Chad)
 *     - DAAC member node (Bruce, Roger)
 *     - Dryad member node (Ryan)
 *     - Generic member node (as replication target)
 *     - Monitoring (Rob)
 *     - CILogon branding (Mark, Jeff)
 * 
 *   iii. Client tools
 * 
 *     - ITK libraries in python and java
 *     - Command line client (Roger, Dave)
 *       - Probably satisfactory for very basic interaction with CN and MN
 *       - Need to verify
 *     - R client (Matt)
 *       - (EVA experiment) Should be fairly straight forward to execute within D1
 *       - Read data from D1 (not dependent on authentication)
 *     - Zotero (Bruce, Ryan) 
 *       - goal similar to do something as Dryad does - e.g. RDFa tags in HTML output
         -  Add tags to mercury html page output
         
 *     - Morpho (Chad)
 *       - Use to add content to D1.
        - Depends on authentication stuff
        - fall back is to use existing interface to inject content into Metacat
        - Adapting Morpho would emphasize the issues associated with implementation 
 *  
 *     - EVA (Paul and Matt)
 *        - Met with Daniel and Kevin - putting together R scripts to generate a  couple of frames of the animation output (end of Nov)
 *       - Matt will modify to use the R client
 *       - Moving scripts into VisTrails (Kevin Webb), and Kepler (Matt)?
 * 
 *         - May be possible to enable VisTrails by review time
 * 
 *       - Demo is to do live demo, getting live, toy data set, doing analysis. Also show time-compressed canned animation of actual EVA dataset download, analysis, and visualization.
 *     - (other clients as resources permit)
 * 
 *   iv. Documentation
 * 
 *     - Architecture documentation (cleaned up, html, pdf, epub formats)
 *     - Member node participation documentations
 *     - Investigator toolkit (tools documented, new tool construction document)
 *     - Implementation plan for PASTA
       * overview document of implementing MN functionality / mapping between PASTA and D1




3. Upcoming Semantics working group meeting (Jan 24-26)

Plone: https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/integration-and-semantics
svn: https://repository.dataone.org/documents/WorkingGroups/IntegrationSemantics/20110124_WG_Stanford/
