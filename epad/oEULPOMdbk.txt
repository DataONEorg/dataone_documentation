2012 DataONE Summer Internship Project Proposal

DataONE internship project designed to create citation and usage reports that integrate into the DataONE site and can be used as well in standalone tools.

Data usage and citation synopsis

Use the DataONE aggregated log facility on Coordinating Nodes to create a continually-updated summary of data downloads and citations.  Use this summary to provide a nicely formatted display of usage and citations for all of DataONE, for particular Member Nodes, and for particular data sets, possibly including a graph showing usage over time. Also include a summary across all of the datasets for a given user (for data they own and use). Citation and reuse data will be drawn from various sources including PubMed Central, Scopus, PLoS, Twitter, and total-impact.

Collaborate between CI and CE on this project.
