Competitve Landscape

1) Is this the correct break down of organizations?
2) Are there organizations missing?
3) Are there organizations that don't belong?

Business as usual
Educational organizations?  ESIP?  Collaborators; need is so great.
What about commercial publishers?  Competitor?
Within standards community, add NISO (?).  
Tool providers don't seem to be represented.
Box.net .com group (Internet 2) {perhaps this goes under Cyberinfrastructure Development Organizations}
DIdgital preservation network - in its infancy but will have a relationship in this
Significant competition / collaboration in training.
NCBI Genbank - missing?
====================================================================
Email from Todd:
It occurs to me that another important organization in the competitor/collaborator landscape for DataONE is DataPASS: http://www.data-pass.org/about.jsp

It is perhaps more similar to DataONE in structure and value  proposition than many of the other efforts currently being considered.   Though it is restricted to Social Sciences.
====================================================================

Will this be taken to the next step to stategize how we are going to leverage this? A. Yes. 

Some big names are not familiar with DataONE - need to get the message out there.

Repositories
 - Include all three national data centers (NOAA....)
 - DataNet projects.  Are they listed?
-  Open Topography

EarthCube - how related to DataONE? {competitive/collaboration overlap}

Slide: Digital Libraries
Umbrella organizations:
 * University libraries
 * ANDS
 * ArchiX

Cyberinfrastructure Development Organizations}
 * iRods is the software not the Dev Org (include RENCI?)
 * Unidata {have UCAR & NCAR but should also have Unidata}
 * GEOSS
 * OGC covered somewhere else?
 * NSF Ocean Observatory


Partnership Guidelines
Goal was light weight document describing roles & responsibilities of MN

Network responsibilities: emergency contact should be in roles and responsibilites instead
(item 7 on slide)

Service responsibilities: 
illegal content subject of discussion by CCIT - the need for a universal "kill" switch to immediately takedown content (re: legal takedown notices).   Covered by c) under DataONE Service Responsibilities?
Grammar of item 3(slide only?) (note: in the doc it is OK as 3 and 4 are actually 1 bullet - (b))
What does item 8 mean?  ownership of data and metadata - archives take responsibility for datasets - this item doesn't refer to the MN - it's saying DataONE doesn't claim ownership

Network responsibilities:
The 'Attribution' bullet is repeated btn DataONE services and DataONE network (not word for word, but in meaning)
