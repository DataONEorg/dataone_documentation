MN Wrangler Meeting
                    Remove table hover row highlighting
                    Add Replication node text in tooltip popup on 'name' hover
                    Remove logo column/link from Replication table
                    Add member node document column for 'upcoming' nodes table
                    Tooltips in new tables. (the on hover tooltips for columns in new tables)
                    Update 'Status' legend with 'upcoming/in progress' status


OUTSTANDING ISSUES:
============================

align bottom row of the node detail - mn doc, status

- Check each MN for correct 'dateUploaded' dates - should be when the object was uploaded to the MN repository
    - This is a task outside of the UI work. Assign to Chris J.
- We need to get transparent backgrounds for MN images (Amber)
- Logos need to be the same height, and UC3 Merrit should be cropped to logo dimensions (less white space)
    - Amber is on it.
- Preferred MN breadcrumb abbreviation text values.
- 'Upcoming Member Nodes' section - do we keep this?  
    --- Add this to the bottom of the new page based on current layout
            -- possibly add new table style for 'upcoming' table
            -- add as a drupal 'node'?  or just raw html at bottom of the dashboard main html page
- Three replication nodes listing - do we keep this?
    - Add to bottom of the new page
        - prose text or table


Summary Page
============

- Fix page header
    - Search box is misaligned - DONE
    - Check font size / link behavior in LHN, breadcrumb areas - DONE
- Fix alignment of data/metadata upload legend boxes - DONE

- On hover over a MN row, there's no visual feedback on the different links in the row because the whole row is clickable
    - remove row hover click behavior, make each 'action' seperate hover areas to indicate seperate actions.
    - DONE

- Dates for "last harvested" are really the date of the newest content that was retrieved from the MN, i.e. the youngest content.
    - change label to 'last updated'
    - DONE

- On smaller viewports, Top summary boxes collapse to be unviewable
    - DONE - set display to inline-block
    
- Under the status: capitalize OK =)
    -DONE

- For the main summary page boxes, remove 'at the listed Repository', but keep it on the Detail pages
    -DONE

GRAPH ISSUES:
==================
    - For the graph, put the years under the months, or Jan 13, Feb 13, etc
        - DONE
    - Graph: horizontal lines should line up with a tick mark
        - axis label tick marks should align with dashed value lines
        - DONE
- KU and cornell node graphs have lines directly on top of each other
        - make one dashed ?
        - small offset of orange line to show both...    
     - DONE, added offset to second line of 2 pixels in x,y directions        

MN Detail page:
============
- Online with DataONe on: change to 'Online with DataONE' or 'Newest Content' and summary page
    -DONE

- Use consistent time formatting for dates on these pages
    - Drop the time portion from 'last harvest'
    - DONE

- Change 'Last Harvested' to 'Last Updated' 'Newest Content'
    -DONE

- Use 'Detail of <MN Name>' in the MN Detail page title
    -DONE

- Add MN document links for SEAD and USNPN
    -DONE
    
- Page transitions from summary to detail view sometimes leaves user at bottom of detail view
    - on transition to summary, scroll to top
    - on transition to detail, scroll to top if nav from summary (not when moving between nodes)
    - DONE

Releasing to the public website
========================

- Left hand navigation integration
  - Menus will match. Skye and Chris A. will work on this
  - DONE
  
- Breadcrumb
    - Needs to be updated with the navigation:
    -- Home >> Participate >> Member Nodes >> Current Member Nodes >> Member Node Detail (abbreviated name)
    -- Change window.location on navigation to node detail.......invokes page load but may help breadcrumbing?
     -- text should be black, no link    
    - DONE  (need to confirm, define abbreviations)


- Update Redmine with:
  - Abbreviated Member Node Name
  - MN document location
  - Logo location
  - MN URL
  - MN full name (actually, in the Node Registry)
  - lat/lon
  - official description (also in the Node Registry)

V2 notes:
=======
Storage refactoring:
- We want to centralize storage of a number of MN attributes. Some are in redmine, some in the CN Node Registry, etc.
- Currently, Skye is storing cached text files in the Drupal filesystem.  these need to be updated programmatically in V2
'Upcoming Member Nodes' section location may not be best suited at the bottom.

Final Review:
==========
Wednesday, 4pm MT, Skye will send out a GoToMeeting email
