  Assessments Sub-Group: U&A and Sociocultural Working Group
  May 5, 2011
  Library and Librarians Surveys:
  The Library survey is sent to directors of libraries to get official library policy and practices regarding all aspects of Research Data Services (RDS). The Librarians survey is sent to individual librarians to get their opinions, experiences, and perceptions regarding RDS. The intention is to capture information that will inform DataONE on the barriers and needs of libraries regarding all aspects of the data lifecycle. Results will help DataONE understand what types of education, training materials, and technical support and design considerations will assist the library communities. Work began on the 2 surveys in summer 2010 with the DataONE internship program, led by mentors Bob Sandusky and Suzie Allard.
  Tenopir presented preliminary results from the library and librarians surveys. The initial surveys were targeted to 105 academic research libraries that are members of the Association of Research Libraries and science, data, and subject specialty librarians that work in those libraries.  These surveys were launched April 15, 2011 and will remain open through June. 
  The first tasks for this subgroup are to: 1) adapt the questions of the library and librarians surveys for an extended audience, 2) expand the list of prospective participants in academic and government (federal and state) libraries.
  To reach additional academic libraries we will collaborate with the American Library Association (ALA), Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) to reach other academic libraries and librarians. They have a directors list as well as subject sections, so they can help us reach the directors with the Library survey and individual librarians with the Librarians survey. Denise will follow-up with ACRL to request assitance in distributing the surveys.
  For government libraries, the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) survey section will be contacted to help reach federal libraries and librarians. Lisa will follow-up with FLICC to request assistance in distributing the surveys. For state libraries, the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies (COSLA) Research and Statistics Committee chair, Peggy Rudd in Texas. Denise will follow-up to request assistance in distributing the surveys.  
  The goal is to get the extended academic surveys and the government variations out in May and June 2011. Revised Word versions of the survey instruments are available on the dataone.docs site in the May 2011 working group folder. Results of both the Library and Librarians surveys will be presented at the October DataONE All-Hands meeting, with publication in a peer reviewed journal targeted for late 2011. At that time Denise will contact American Libraries Direct to see about wider distribution of the results.  The data set from the surveys will be deposited in a DataONE member node at the time of publication.
 These  surveys focus on libraries and librarians in North American (Canada and the US). The Parse Insight survey focused on libraries, publishers, and scientists in Europe. After the North American surveys are complete, the Working Group will explore the possibility of expanding these surveys internationally.  Denise will follow-up with ALA International Relations Office to see about IFLA assistance in distributing surveys more broadly.
 
  
  Next stakeholder baseline assessment: Data Managers
  
  It was decided that the next group to be surveyed will be Data Managers, because they represent a logical next step in understanding the data lifecycle. Many of the issues and questions asked in the scientist and librarians baseline assessments were repurposed for the Data Managers. Going from data generators (scientists) to data handlers (librarians and data managers) and, later, to data consumers (educators/public policy makers) is a natural progression in survey execution.
  The  draft data manager survey instrument is available on the dataone.docs site in the May meeting folder. The results of this survey will help answer questions about all parts of the data lifecycle, including what types of data they manage, who they support, disciplines represented, tools and standards used and improvements needed, existence of and support for data management planning, barriers to and incentives for sharing data, and organizational challenges.
  Demographic questions will allow us to cluster results by full or part time data management, subject discipline, size of organization/agency, educational background of data managers, and geographic location.
  Results will provide DataONE participants with a clear understanding of the challenges and barriers to data sharing from the perspective of data managers, as well as insights into the data management profession.
  Data managers located in herbaria, state and federal government, and not-for-profit organizations will be among those being surveyed. Strategies for reaching these data managers include: working through professional organizations including Ecological Society of America (ESA), OFWIM (Organization of Fish and Wildlife Information Managers), American Institute for Biological Sciences (AIBS),  Earth Sciences Information Professionals (ESIP), Natural Sciences Collection Alliance (NSCA), Society of Herbarium Curators, etc. Additional suggestions from the DataONE community are welcome.  When the survey is ready to be deployed Lisa will assist with connecting to these organizations.
  This survey will be finalized and pre-tested in summer and early fall 2011, with a goal of distribution late fall 2011-2012.
  
  Baseline Assessment of Educators:
  
  Carly Strasser, post-doc at NCEAS, is leading an assessment of undergraduate educators. Middle and high school (grades 6-12) educators will be another stakeholder group assessed, starting in 2012.  We began brainstorming about the educators assessment, including questions to be answered and background resources needed before a survey instrument and frame can be developed.
•Questions
–What do teachers do about data?
–How to teach teachers; how to collect, describe, share data? + software training
–Provide examples to teachers
–Do teachers instruct students in metadata standards and searching for data?
–Do they share with other schools, contribute to other datasets?
–Is there school media center/librarian and how do they support such activities?
•Resources
–Bruce Grant, Cliff Duke, Carl Strasser
–www.dataintheclassroom.org  & linked to NODE (they have curriculum design)
–Need to do a meta-analysis of surveys that have already been done
–Technology-supported inquiry learning (stanford.edu Daniel C. Edelson (Northwestern Uni., IL))
–National Science Teachers Association
  
  Summary
  Results and data from library and librarians surveys will be distributed to working members for discussion at the October 2011 AHM; draft instruments for the data managers survey will be distributed summer 2011 to members. Results from these surveys and further discussion of developing the educators survey will be on the agenda for the October 2011 AHM.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    `First Task:
To Library survey need to make all that apply work for who in the library is responsible for RDS
Maybe also add specific subject discipline units/librarians as drop down.

Send Library/librarian surveys to Lisa to make sure ok for federal.
Need head of all USGS libraries and other agencies to fill out library survey and pass on the librarian survey to their staff.
FLICc--federal libraries and information center committee is a way to contact federal libraries, but it is too high a level (cabinet level) to use as a mailing list. Use their directory of federal libraries.  Need a list of agency libraries, like EPA, USGS, also national libraries like NLM, NAL, FDA. Just send to research libraries. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, National Labs (ORNL, Livermore, Los Alamos, etc.)
Ask permission to distribute librarian survey through the federal agency director. 

For librarian survey change to all post secondary degree to get subjects; change faculty, students, or staff; eliminate students only questions, change faculty or staff to researchers, staff, or administrators/program managers; change off campus to off site; on campus to on campus. Except consultation questions ask separately about administrators/program managers; researchers and staff.  Take out demographic questions about their university type and number of students. Instead ask: to whom do you report; eg department head, bureau chief, etc.. What is the primary subject discipline of your library? --earth and environmental sciences; social sciences, including...; health/medicine; engineering; education; law; atmoshperic sciences. Secondary check all that apply (NSF's 9 fields of science)

Without research data services by a library, researchers will not preserve data for future use by others. substitute for the question on graduates...


Add a question to both this and library survey about their agency: 
Does your agency... conduct research (yes or no); have a regulatory responsibility (yes or no); inform policy makers, including congress (yes or no); is your agency a primary creator of data?; secondary analysis of others' data; (check all that apply??) does your agency support the provision of data, preservation... is this part of the core mission 


Library survey change "other units in your University" to agency
change academic program to researchers; change other institutions to other agencies
change faculty, staff, or students TO researchers, staff, or administrators
Change either on or off campus to either onsite or offsite.

Next steps on library/librarians
Follow up for ARL--send a postcard
    a. federal agencies
    b. Mary Jane Petrosky at ACRL might be willing to sell us their email list for the ACRL survey respondents if we share our findings. It will be the library mailing list, just directors, and send them both surveys, asking them to distribute the librarian survey.  On June 1 the data goes into http://nces.ed.gov (NCES Library Comparison) Denise will help us find the emails.
    c.MAYBE international

To the plans, future, add a NO without any timeline

SECOND TASK:
What is the next group we should survey?
1.    Data Managers (maybe also public policy makers; land managers; resource managers; state and provincial agencies; planners; herbarium (Jean Freeny); GBIF for museums). Lisa can help us compile a list --OFWIM is a good start for state agencies. They are great advocates and do training.  Natural Science Collections Alliance (animal collections)
    a. Canada and the US first
    b.  IABIN for Latin America (need to be in Spanish and English) scientists and data managers
    c. IFLA or EU to get international agencies 

Questions to ask:
1) what % of time spent on data management; research; training/teaching

Wednesday afternoon:research questions for data managers

Add in the invitation letter what the benefits to them will be, add a question at the end that lets them see results (add address and separate from their answers.)

You are invited to participate in an NSF-sponsored research study investigating how scientists work.  Your responses will help us better understand how scientists manage their data and will contribute to building better tools and processes for data preservation.



The questionnaire should take about 15 minutes to complete.

Your participation in this research is voluntary, and you may decline to participate without risk.  While it is useful to be complete in your responses to the survey, you may skip any questions, and you are free to withdraw from the study at any time until your survey is returned (we have no way of identifying your particular responses).  We will not link your survey responses to you in any way, and we ask that you do not put any other identifying information on the survey. This will help ensure that survey responses will be anonymous.  In addition, individual responses will be kept confidential, and information from the survey will only be reported in aggregate.  As such, we do not anticipate that your participation poses any risk.
 
If you have any questions about the study or procedures, please contact Carol Tenopir (ctenopir@utk.edu) or Suzie Allard (sallard@utk.edu).  If you have questions about your rights as a participant, contact the Office of Research Compliance Officer at (865) 974-3466.
