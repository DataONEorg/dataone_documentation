Agenda for 2013-02-22 

1) CI Update (Vieglais)
Everything is good in the CI world - production and preparations for the review. Some small changes are being requested before the R package can be distributed from the CRAN site. Still having some issues getting the Dryad MN online before the review.  Need to give Ryan sufficient time to work through the known issues. Discussion of obstacles presented to prospective MNs based on the requirements to become a MN. Actual implementations tend to point out problems or challenges in the requirements. Some good progress was made on identifiers at the CCIT meeting in Santa Barbara. Production is now at 1.1.1.
Next steps for developers is triage on list of tasks, Member Node deployment, and getting ONEDrive ready for usability testing at joint U&A WG and Sociocultural WG meeting in Knoxville.
