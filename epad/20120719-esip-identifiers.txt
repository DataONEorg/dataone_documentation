ESIP Identifier Testbed
-----------------------------------

See: http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Interagency_Data_Stewardship/Identifiers

MODIS Data: http://dx.doi.org/10.5060/D4CC0XMZ

Four types of IDs described:

1. UniqueID
   Pointer to given object regardless of location
   
2. Unique Location
   Pointer to location of an object
   
3. Citable
   Identifer that can be used in a citation
   
4. ScientificallyMeaningfulID
    Pointer to a scientifically menaingfule data object, which is invariant even if the format or representation of the data set changes
    

Recommendations:
-----------------------------
   DOI for citation IDs
   UUID for unique identifier
   

Naming granules that are part of larger packages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Unrelated IDs
2) Name granules relative base id of containing package
     doi:10.5060/D4RN35SD/baird1929090101
     ----------------------------------/-------------------------
     base identifier              / local identifier   
3) Base id with partial redirect (using suffix path resolution)


Resolution -- what does it mean?
------------------------------------------------
According to IDF: Resolve = redirect to landing page
According to Apache: Redirect to resource, but any form based on content negotiation
For DataONE: Resolve = find multiple locators for object bytes


Questions
---------------
 * Persistence is a social or maintenance issue
 * Example of using opaque IDs to ensure persistence (avoiding social stigmas)
 * Role of signaling in persistence -- identifier schemes have different expectations of persistence
     http URIs
     doi URIs
     UUID URIs
* Issues with authority
    * with DOIs, the naming authority can be changed on the resource owner
