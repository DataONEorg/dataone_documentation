------Notes for CEE report from AHM for Rebecca et al to use in meeting report--------------
The Community Engagement & Education Working Group had its first meeting 2-3 Nov at the All Hands Meeting. 
 
The CEE Working Group identified several areas in which we could have short-term and long-term impact, and areas of overlap with the other groups.  One subgroup focused on training materials – best practices for data and metadata management – that could be available as materials on the website and training modules that could be deployed in many different contexts and disseminated on the DataONE website. This group has already identified areas of the data lifecycle in which they could create training modules; the work has been assigned to members with an interim video conference scheduled for December to update each other on progress. Another subgroup focused on other modes of engaging the scientific community at this stage in DataONE’s development, when the primary need is for capacity building, preparing the community to manage and share data. This group drafted ideas for manuscripts that would use literature surveys and analysis of funding and data sharing patterns to demonstrate the importance of data sharing to the scientific community, for publication in the peer-reviewed literature. Initial work has begun on a manuscript about data sharing in ecology.  The group discussed a potential survey that could be done in collaboration with the Usability & Assessment Working Group to broaden the group of survey participants, and considered the potential overlap of the the Sociocultural group's "success stories" with the manuscripts in preparation.
