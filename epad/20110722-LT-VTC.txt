DataONE—Observation Network for Earth
Leadership Team Charter 
This charter is in effect for the term of the DataONE award or until a formal legal organization, such as a 501(c)(3), is formed.  
Background
It is an immense challenge to provide persistent, universal and easy access to data about life on Earth and the environment that sustains it. To meet this and similar grand challenges, the National Science Foundation established the DataNet Program.    In response to this Program call, a team of diverse multi- and interdisciplinary scientists began planning for the establishment of a DataNet partnership focused on understanding the nature and pace of change on Earth – DataONE (Observation Network for Earth).   This team was formed based on past successful collaborative research efforts, an eye toward diversity of members and organizations, and inclusion of individuals committed to changing the scientific culture related to preservation, access, and management of data.      
The DataONE Leadership Team was formed, primarily of the Investigators on the original proposal, to provide both short-term and long-term leadership and technical direction to the project. 
Purpose, Scope, Mission
The DataONE Leadership Team is responsible for providing strategic and operational advice and recommendations to the Principle Investigator, Executive Director, and Directors for Development & Operations (D&O) and Community Engagement & Outreach (CE&O) (collectively referred to as the DataONE Office) related to DataONE activities.   The Leadership Team is responsible for evaluating progress, resolving conflicts, and identifying working group participants.
Duration of Working Group   
The DataONE Leadership Team will exist throughout the duration of the project.   
Major Objectives
The primary objectives of the DataONE Leadership Team are to support to the DataONE Office in the functions below and to provide advice, recommendations, ideas, and consultation to DataONE Office.  
   *

   * Provide input to DataONE Directors performance,      when requested
   * 
Expected Outcomes & Schedule 
Various reports, recommendations, and white papers will result from the Leadership Team activities.   
Potential Risks
Potential risks related to the DataONE Leadership Team include: 
   *  
   * Member’s inability to participate either based      on conflicting priorities, job change, or other unforeseen      circumstances.   
   *  
   * Necessary funding to support in-person meetings      is unavailable.    
   *  
   * Inability of members to participate long-term      in Leadership Team activities
   * 
 
 
Membership
The DataONE Leadership Team is a representative body, reflecting the diverse viewpoints and participants from the Investigators (PI, Co-PIs, and Co-Is), and collaborators on the DataONE Project.  The Leadership Team will consist of DataONE staff including: 
   *  
   * Principle Investigator, ex officio member
   *  
   * Executive Director, ex officio member, will      serve as the lead for the group
   *  
   * Directors (D&O; CE&O), ex officio      members
   *  
   * Co-PIs and subset of Co-Is 
   *   
   * ========== see line below ==========================
   * No more than 12  total members will be on the Team.  
   * 
DataONE Leadership Team members are determined in a consultative manner with the DataONE Directors, Investigators (PI, Co-PIs, and Co-Is), and existing Leadership Team members.  
While the expectation and intent is that the Leadership Team will work together in a spirit of cooperation, respect, integrity, and scientific cooperation, the DataONE Principle Investigator has the authority to remove any member of the Leadership Team and to make appointments to fill any vacancies on the Leadership Team. 
Roles & Responsibilities 
DataONE Leadership Team decisions are made, when possible, by consensus by all involved.   Majority support for all decisions will be sought by the Team to insure buy-in and differing opinions are fully understand and evaluated before final decisions are made by the Team.  
If no decision can be agreed upon by the Leadership Team, the DataONE Principle Investigator will make the final decision.  
Resources (travel, budget, students, etc.)
The DataONE Leadership Team will utilize the DataONE Collaboration Forum for document development, review, versioning, and archival of documents.
The Leadership Team will use Desktop Sharing (Web Ex), Video Conference (e.g. Marratech), and Conference Bridge capabilities.  
Funding for travel is provided to support member participation in in-person meetings.   
No specific salary is to be provided for member participation.    
 
 
Relationship to other Working Groups
The Leadership Team will be responsible for evaluating progress, changing directions, resolving conflicts, identifying co-chairs, and recommending working group participants across the DataONE project.  A close collaboration between the DataONE Office, Leadership Team, CCIT, EOT, Working Groups, and External Advisory Committee is imperative for DataONE success.     
Communication Plan & Reporting Requirements 
Effective communication is paramount to DataONE success.   A formal communications plan, as a component of the DataONE governance, will be developed as part of the project.  This plan will include the communication mechanisms for all DataONE Working Groups, Network Office, and other team members.   The DataONE Leadership Team will:    
   *  
   * Meet weekly via video/conference calls 
   *  
   * In-person meetings will be held quarterly at      various sites in conjunction with other DataONE meetings, workshops, or      symposiums.    
   * 
The DataONE Office with input from the LT will prepare Quarterly Status Reports on DataONE progress toward outcomes and deliverables and distribute  to all DataONE Investigators, External Advisory Board Members, and other interested parties.”
