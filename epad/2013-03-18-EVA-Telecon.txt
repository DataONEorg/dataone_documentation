Background:  January Workshop:  http://epad.dataone.org/2013-01-22-EVA-Wkshp



Notes
1.  NSF review - Bob
    presentation on EVA given at the NSF Reverse Site Visit (February 28) will be added to the Wiki
    includes several short screen casts of the functionality
    
    
2.  UV-CDAT
 * Review of featues in current UV-CDAT binary release - Yaxing and Jorge
   * Version 1.2:  currently available from LLNL
     * selected features are available: Parallel Coordinates, Multi-Dimensional Scaling, Linked Views, dendrograms, Interactive time series.
     * Missing features: Selecting Ecoregions, import dataset by HTTP protocol.

    
 * tutorials:  http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/wiki/VideoTutorials
        View especially the General Tutorials

 * Installing UV-CDAT
     UV-CDAT binary releases can be found at http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/install/.
         c-make installation
     Having questions about installation? Please contact:
       - Jorge Poco: jpocom@gmail.com
       - Ben Burnett: benjam.arlyn@gmail.com

 * April release of UV-CDAT (no earlier than April 10)
   * Jorge working with Ben to add functions
   * will have all the features that Jorge added (demo'd) 
    

3.  Critical evaluation of common figures / maps for terrestrial biosphere modeling results -- Aritra
    Evaluation based on three criteria:
 * visualization approaches that are typically used  for carbon model visualizations
   * five different images --mixtures of data types (numerical, spatial, temporal, categorical)
 * design problems that are generalizable, and 
 * sufficient level of visualization complexity for them to be redone

March 31 deadline for conference paper
will have a draft in the next few days; will need to have some domain specific text for context

would like to have more papers and visualizations aligned with the current scope?
Scope:  static visualizations for terrestrial biosphere models (flux, biomass), multiple models??
Send request to a bigger community, for example the North American Carbon Program (NACP), to seek more figures/maps/plots, 


-maps, scatterplots, line plots, 
general types of figures under two different schemes: climate change science and visualization science.


Bill Hargrove:
    current categories are general    
    maybe generate some specific categories (difference maps; comparisons; time series)
        strengths / weaknesses
    turn to interactive figures (from static)
  
4.  Machine learning and visualization interactions - Forrest, Bill, and Jorge (briefly)
    Forrest has provided some data; perhaps looking at clustering / visualization 
    
        
5.  Summer Interns  -- Bob and Yaxing
 * DataONE Intern: Build Fundamental Components for Provenance-aware Model Exploration, Evaluation, and Benchmarking Cyber-infrastructure Prototype
     See http://www.dataone.org/internships, project 8).
     This is an activity related to the "working group 5" we discussed at New York EVA workshop (http://epad.dataone.org/2013-01-22-EVA-Wkshp).
     You're very welcome to provide suggestions on what "core" functionalities that you want UV-CDAT/VisTrails to provide to help model data exploration, analysis, and evaluation.

 * ORNL Interns
