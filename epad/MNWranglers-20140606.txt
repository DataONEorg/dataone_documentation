        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest)
        
                MN Dashboard - discussed load time issue 5/30/14, Dave is putting in a ticket to resolve
                Last week's notes:
                         The dashboard is in production and we have a news item ready to  release, but there have been some difficulties with load time and  incomplete loads. 
                         We (Bruce, John, Laura) tried pulling up the dataone.org site, and the  dashboard, with varying results using Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari
                        Dave will put in a ticket for this

(Hold off on this until everyone present)
                Purpose of MN Description Document (past and future) - past: identify data holdings (type, volume, etc.), operations, to aid in MN development.  future: ???  
                
        1.5   Current MNs
                 CDL's synchronization is still turned off - Laura to ask Chris about CDL's current status
                
        2. Status of upcoming MNs
    
     * Y5Q4
       * LTER-Europe  (3232) - News item approved; Laura/Amber to coordinate move to production/announcement  - Whoops!  issues with no resource maps, Chris assisting
       * EDAC (3221) -  Soren  says EDAC is ready to go; email in to Rob inquiring actual status  (flurry of activity before AHM); Laura/Amber to coordinate move to  production/announcement.  Have a note in to Rob inquiring as to current status.  Last we spoke, harvesting has begun and he was doing those final checks.
       * DFC (3532) -  Bruce has corresponded with Lisa; following up
       * MPC (3708) - registering in sandbox - Laura needs to touch base.
       * ORNL MNs (RGD (4248) and EDORA (4247)) - moved to "testing", MNDDs/logo for EDORA and RGD received from Bob; Jim is registering both in staging; in meeting 5/29/14, 
       * GLEON (3422) - Corinna  was at the MNF yesterday; she's coming to the DUG; it may take some  selling to convince other folks involved with GLEON management that it's  a good thing to participate with DataONE (was DataONE participation a  deliverable on their contract?)
       * PPBio (3748)  -  After moving their server to LNCC, they have decided to revert to  the original location in Manaus.  When this is accomplished, we expect  to move quickly.
       * NKN (3238) - Ed was at the MNF yesterday; working right along
       * SAEON (3205) - Chris is working with Alex to find a time when they can upgrade their metacat

    Future
       * TERN  Australia (4286): Met with Alison/Amber at AHM to work on  education/outreach items (draft MOU scope item C);  some changes in  funding down under.    
         * Hope  to meet with Nikki Thurgate when she's in the states, perhaps around  DUG; working on scope items A and B in particular, meeting again in  June.
       * IARC   (International Arctic Research Center) (4700) - Jim, Mike, Tim and Laura met this week to discuss GeoNetwork questions; Jim to start serious development week of 6/2/14
       * EU BON -- Looking to deploy a test MN (probably Sierra Nevada) in the next 6-9 months. 

        3. Old action items
             MN Documentation - MN Deployment and MN Ongoing Operations - holding
             
        4. Not-high profile issues
     * Redmine ticket generator - plan to apply to IARC and GBIF
       
        5. Around the room
