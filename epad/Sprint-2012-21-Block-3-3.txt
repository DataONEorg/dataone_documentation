Notes from 6/1/2012

Robert Waltz

  Completed changes to d1_libclient_java/synchronizaton/logAggregation that deals timeout problems. 
  
  Start the process of producing release candidates for all the components.  Assuming some components may need a further release early next week. But want to get production machines built with a release to prepare for MN releases next week.


Roger

- Fixed timeout issue on GMN replication
- Looked into GMN buffering issue (not yet resolved)


Andy

- Python code has been changed for .../object/<pid>  ==>  .../resolve/<pid>
- Waiting for dev to be updated so I can test.

Chris

 * worked with skye on replication testing.  Tracked down two small bugs that were causing failures
   * CN.deleteReplicationMetadata() threw an exception when it shouldn't due to a typo. Fixed
   * SystemMetadataFactory in Metacat was producing empty AccessPolicy entries on certain pids. Fixed.
 * Locking changes in d1_replication are working in the latest runs
   * tracking down individual pid issues. GMN was timing out, leaving pids in the requested state. Roger has added in a fix
 * Will be working on larger runs today. Previous runs have no failed replica entries, but we didn't get a 'perfect' run (ie expected 198 replicas, got 140) After calling evict/get (emulating an audit), we got 191 of 198. Encouraging.


Skye

Replication work. Setting up runs. ReplicationTasks were getting stuck in different states.

Mercury search changes. mostly CSS and logo and header layouts. Now on cn-dev-2.       mercury problem with SOLR query. fixed.
    May be outstanding UI changes coming in from LT.

Resource Map with type of  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar . Is this a valid format?  -- If change required here, will effect index_processor, index_build_tool components only.  May just need to update the ResourceMapParser class to add this namespace.

Jing

  Reviewing Morpho code - figure out methods/actions used in Metacat, determine how to replace them with D1 API methods.  Design phase, present it next week.
  
  For account information, look at the CNIdentity API:

Ben

  Able to Synchronize a clean CN to two other running CNs.  So a CN can come up from a clean state.  Forces a running CN to push all the content through. A restart is needed, it is convenient (?) . Similar to how Metacat used to load everything from backing store.
