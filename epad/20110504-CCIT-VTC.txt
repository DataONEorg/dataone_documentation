Agenda
------

1. General update on CI development activities

- Fixing many sticky bugs in various pieces of infrastructure, several issues related to the addition of DataONE services to Metacat seem to be resolved now

- Refactoring APIs for MN tiers

- Working through Authn, Authz, IdP issues, starting implementation

2. Outcomes from USGS ITK workshop held April 26-27 in Denver

- Lots of interest and enthusiasm for collaborating with DataONE

- Key activities:

  - Enable reserveIdentifier() in DataONE CNs with EzID integration

  - Integrate metadata dev tools with sciencebase.gov uploader

  - Enable Windows support for the DataONE drive concept (currently linux / OS X FUSE only)

  - Establish BIP member node (USGS NBII)

  - Evaluate DataONE authn/authz infrastructure

  - Develop an ArcGIS plugin for exporting data + metadata to DataONE

Bob S wrking with Mike and others to further refine the outcomes form USGS meeting.
How to proritize tool development?
Survey focused on users of MNs that are targeted in the near future to evaluate the tools that are currently in use.
- Which tools and also what needs to change in the tools?
- Survey to focus on which tools and what is good/bad
- Main issue is that DatONE does not have resources to alter functionality of tools other than to enable support of DataONE services.
- Commercial tools - ArcGIS, SAS, [Metavist (.net)]


3. Progress and plans for MN implementations

- TeraGrid
  - Good progres smade to date with installation of Metacat and GMN to initiate the evaluation of information flow in and out of the TG.

- Dryad

  - Basic node up and running, ready to tie in with a CN
  - http://datadryad.org/mn/
  - Quick member node tester  https://github.com/NESCent/dataone-ws-tester (Ryan will move into the DataONE svn)

- USGS NBII (targeted by USGS activities, Giri to lead, target of Dec 2011)

- CUAHSI-HIS
  - Dave to contact Jeff for progress update

- AKN
  - D1 intern focused on this project (Vivek)
  - Should start about May 23
  - Start off using Metacat for this implementation
  - Main activities will be on pushing data into metacat

- Merritt
  - John indicated Merritt is ingesting about 17,000 machine-readable water quality reports from UC Davis.
  - Dave to contact John and get update on plans for MN API implementation


4. CCIT meeting agenda and overlap with the working group on Integration and Semantic

- Mostly focus on the public release progress of the infrastructure
- General goal to have alpha / pre-alpha versions of all major pieces of infrastructure to fully evaluate the realistic targets for the years end.
- Good opportunity to also plan for the ongoing interactions with the various wroking groups especially for the period immedately after the public release
- Goal for interaction with WG-IS is primarily to bring WG participants up to speed on the details of architecture and infrastructure being developed in DataONE.

5. Select a new technology to trial for developer calls.

- Review of technologies done by NCEAS: http://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/Video_Conferencing_Software_Comparison

- Next meeting will be held using EVO ( http://evo.caltech.edu/evoGate/ ). Dave will book meeting and forward details for CCIT / Developers for next dev call.


6. Any other business

None.
