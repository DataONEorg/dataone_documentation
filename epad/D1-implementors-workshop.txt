Proposal for a DataONE Implementors Workshop
====================================

Overview
--------------
This one-day workshop will provide training and instruction for the technical community to build software that integrates with the DataONE system. We will provide an overview of the DataONE infrastructure, along with technical tutorials on how to implement a Member Node software stack and an Investigator Toolkit component that utilizes DataONE services.

Date
------
September 30, 2011 

Venue
---------
To be held at: NCEAS, Santa Barbara, CA

The workshop will be held following the Environmental Information Management Conference in order to make it easy for participants in that conference to join in.  We expect the audience at EIM 2011 will be just the type of technical information managers and developers that would want to participate in DataONE.  Many of these individuals will already be traveling to Santa Barbara, so it should be minimal additional financial burden for them to stay the extra day for the workshop.  Exposure for DataONE will be substantial at EIM, and will be timed well to coincide with the production release of the DataONE infrastructure.

Technical needs
-----------------------
Sync and repl needs to be done
create new cn buildout to be deployed
    -- include new versions of Mercury, Metacat , indexer, etc.
Need staging nodes for KNB and other nodes (deployed by end of next week)
Registration process for MNs (script) - libclient should be able to do this now when on a CN (and certs setup).
Create VM Ubuntu images, on server? (8 groups of 2)
   -- Include sample data, metadata, resource map for activities
   -- Each VM set up with networking configured (bridged?), static IP in DNS,        
   -- *.test.dataone.org wildcard cert installed
Need staging nodes for CNs (trusting the DataONE CA) end of next week -- cn-ucsb-1, cn-unm-1, cn-orc-1
Make sure people have CILogon accts, create one on protect net if needed
MNs need to retrieve CN subjects from NodeList, use that to verify ops from CNs
