Notes on the UA WG session in block 6

Breakout groups:
1. new dataone web site
2. the "pilot" catalog
3. existing workflow tools
4. existing metadata, data management / creation / deposit tools
5. existing analysis tools (e.g., visualization, stats)

the assessment process should also gather information about what tools (and repositories) are being used.

discussion of need for additional grounding: what are the researcher/citizen scientist /etc. activities that need to be supported by various tools
- this can be satisfied, in part, by:
-- a lit review
-- talking to DataONE insiders
-- talking to outsiders


New scenario (from Alison Specht): one dataset described by different sets of metadata and deposited in three distinct community repositories

This group seems to need a better understanding of the overall flow of data and interaction points of DataONE. E.g., a captioned video animation.

Usability
-- next phase of coordinating nodes (water resources / hydrology, one specific LTER site, an unaffiliated researcher managing his/her own data, a physical collection (e.g., herbarium).

Rama: this is a more bounded problem.

Bruce Grant: also get, if available, their current data management procedures
Get screenshots of their current interfaces
Get existing reports of evaluations of their users
Get some specific users to survey (about 40), interview a subset (about 10)
Gather / develop workflow diagrams

--> look at the Purdue http://wiki.lib.purdue.edu/display/dcp/Purdue-UIUC+Data+Curation+Profiles+Project

Use these as found data
Use these as inspiration for our own investigations
Use as a springboard for adaptations to next version(s) of surveys

Construct any i/v guide to allow probing targeting data producers as distinct from data reusers/consumers
