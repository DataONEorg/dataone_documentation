DataONE Sociocultural portal

Goal of the DataONE Sociocultural portal


Possible implementations:
Discussed several possibilities.  These rose to the top as most appropriate:
 * forum
 * wiki
 * Drupal

Could be hosted in several places:
 * on DataONE's site (ideal but burdonsome for people outside our group)
 * on a forum hosting site (easiest, but not flexible)
 * on a web hosting space with an automated but flexible phpBB install option, like DreamHost (costs money, takes a bit of time, but very flexible) 

Prototype #1a:  Free Forum 

Decided to start with a free hosted phpbb forum site to start through phpbbweb.com
Link to the prototype:  http://dataonesc.s4.bizhat.com/

Seeded with some example structure and content.

Strengths:
Many.  At least in initial work, it does most things that we are interested in well.

Weaknesses:
 * no RSS feeds.  Could get them in hosted version.  There is a "new since you logged in last time" ability
 * no tagging.  Could maybe get it in hosted version

Prototype #1b:  Forum installed in hosted webspace

Due to above issues, decided to experiment with installing phpBB code on my on webspace.

Hosting prices, for reference
 * Dreamhost:  http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html
   * I've used Dreamhost for years and like them a lot (Heather)
   * I'd be willing to be the admin (Heather)
   * $9/month + $10/year if we wanted our own domain
