Participants:  Jane Greenberg, Angela Murillo, Stephen Richard, Brian Wee, Steve Aulenbach, Matt Jones, Karl Benedict, Soren Scott, John Cobb, Filimon, Patrick West, Mary Beth West, Tracy, Steve Morris

Talking points / Guiding Questions
 * What are the main challenges?
 * What solutions currently exist?
 * What contribution can / should DataONE provide in this landscape?  How can that be best achieved?

Main Challenges
Open Access - what is it?
"shades of grey" - 
licenses issue - CC commons not defined for data

 * 3 categories:
   * open for reuse
   * open for attribution
   * open for distribution

 * attribution stacking problem
 * International differences in copyright law and inclusion of data as intellectual property
 * Legal issues - differences between countries
 * Differences on how institutions look at data sharing
 * How to ensure attribution for aggregator's role in data sharing

Solutions
 * Public Domain Dedication and License    (PDDL) Public domain for data/databases
 * Open Database License (ODC-ODbL)    Attribution share-alike for data/databases
 * Attribution License (ODC-By)     Attribution for data/databases
 * Community Norms Document    Use with ODC-ODbL, ODC-By, CC0    Use as a stand alone document to identify community norms and expectations, best practices
 * CC0  Creative Commons Zero  "No Rights Reserved"  no attribution requirement
 * CC BY  Attribution
 * CC BY-SA  Attribution share-alike
 * Are licenses enforcable...will they stand up in court?
 * WC3 - rights ontology - IPROnto
 * Experience on researchers encouraged to share when they know who is downloading the data



DataONE contributions
 * linking licenses to data sets  allowing filtering      which licenses do you use?  Do you specify a license, or a set of licenses?
   * Make them structured/machine-readable licenses attached to data
   * Could also be a 'license thesaurus' (see W3C Rights ontology; IPROnto)
   * Be sure to cover all three axes
     * Re-Use policy
     * Attribution policy
     * Redistribution policy
 * Make recommendations about how to machine link licenses into current metadata standards
   * FGDC, CSDGM/BDP, ISO 19115, EML, etc.
   * Right to redistribute is related to current ReplicationPolicy in SystemMetadata
 * Provenance system can help avoid attribution stacking problem
   * Can also help with showing role of aggregators in curating data objects
   * Provide a machine-readable mechanism to link provenace models into existing metadata standards
   * Or, provide separate mechanism to link prov and metadata (e.g., through ORE)
   * Host a provenance trace construction service
 * Provenance should include the licensing schemes
 * When searching for data, add ability to filter by license type
 * Organize community activities to come to agreement on licensing and data policies
 * Show advantages of sharing data

 * Rights in multiple directions
 * Short / medium / long term
