Participants: Biva, Anand, Saumen, Paolo, Dan Crawl, 

Biva: ...  --> report
Anand: OPM tool, not working
Paolo: What exactly is not working?
Biva: Also had problems with OPM tool
Nobody posted the specific error messages!?
Paolo: please give feedback when tool does not work
What is that other tool?

General comment: please post error messages, problems, (and workarounds!) proactively...

Saumen:
Was able to run FPC in COMAD?

==> put all workflows (3 x 3) on Deliverables & Products

==> swapping: not a priority right now


Biva:
ER model conceptual schema

Anand:
 I created the ER-diagram:  for conceptualization of our plan of exact placement  of SPS and  SDS within the overall picture.
      I will be refining it more.

Kepler SQL schema:

Paolo:
I have been trying to summarize the various contributions into a 
single ER model. Much of this is based on the BLPM sheet on this page: 
https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aj4GvsnUzshadGduS2Q0VklKUmEz... 
I have a diagram for the main structural (workflow) and provenance 
entities: 
http://datatol.googlegroups.com/web/ProvenanceEntities.png?gda=IysvqE... 
and another for the main "OPM-style" properties (either asserted or 
inferred): 
http://datatol.googlegroups.com/web/Provenanceproperties.png?gda=uarM... 
ps I have done these with ArgoUML if anyone needs to edit, I will post the argo file 

and here are the sources I have used to generate the tentative integrated conceptual model:
Anand's ER diagram: 
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/datatol/web/high-level-model-diag.pd... 
  however, this diagram captures mostly meta-information, rather than 
the provenance model itself, so that will come at a later stage 
Anand's conceptual model: 
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/datatol/web/conceptual_schema.pdf?_d... 
By and large, I have also included Biva's model: 
http://datatol.googlegroups.com/web/conceptualSchemaBiva.pdf?gda=2ZDj... 
in the sense that there is a substantial overlap (good and 
unsurprising!) with Andand's model 
this is still all drafty 

in addition to the diagrams, here is the argo file that you can open 
using ArgoUML: 
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/datatol/web/SharedProvenanceModel_PM... 
ArgoUML is available here for free: http://argouml.tigris.org/

what are the questions we might want to ask against this schema 
(in terms of users) can it answer these questions

==> Collect the "20 Questions/Queries"
(aside: The 4th Paradigm book, dedicated to Jim Gray)

Paolo: 
Moving to implementations of the (integrated) schema

[Manish has QLP implementation in relational DB] 

Dan:
Using HSQL in Kepler
Java PI

Biva:
D1-->WF-->D2
What about the intermediate data?

To what extent is the system (and the provenance system) aware of references?
Paolo: Taverna is "aware" of references
Next version LOD compliant references

Anand: where do we store the actual data?

Paolo: in the SPS, we have to have the data somewhere
have a distributed system with large data store

Bertram to ask DataONE project for that "data store" 

Saumen: CouchDB possible store

Shared data store at google?

NEXT ACTIONS:
* Anand, Biva, Saumen to put "products" and "deliverables"
on the corresponding page on the DToL page
* also create / link-to "homepage" 


* Bertram: take crack at shared conceptual model/schema,
starting from Paolo's version & other versions
--> slides, and write-up 
=> shoot for end of week for a "1st complete draft"
=> finalize by next call

* Write 20 (not really) questions: what we should ask of the provenance store 
==> goal: agreed upon ones should become benchmarks for the overall project
==> should include "export native provenance" queries

* Explore implementation and query (API access) alternatives,
run some key queries against it
1a) Anand: "stand up" Dan's DB as a separate entity
1b)
2a) Biva: Taverna provenance API (build problems)
2b)
3a) Saumen: Manish's QLP implementation  
3b)
