 of DataONE UA Work Plan & Strategy

Outline

Background:

The DataONE Usability & Assessment working group has the primary responsibility for leading and implementing Usability and Assessment related Programs within the DataONE network. The working group focus's on the research, development, and implementation of the necessary processes, systems, and methods to insure DataONE products and services meet network goals, include appropriate community involvement, and demonstrate progress and achievements of DataONE. 

The working group has been supporting various analysis of DataONE and partner tools/services since it's existence in 2010.  

This document identifies the major activities of the working group related to Usability Testing, Analysis, and Data summarization from May 2012 through December 2012. 


The usability testing sub-group proposes a two-pronged strategy for usability activities over the course of 2012:
 * an immediate short term strategy that will support the official Summer, 2012 release of the Dataone.org and OneMercury website
 * a longer term testing that will help achieve overall objectives of the site for meeting user needs and providing ease of use.

In early May, 2012, the sub-group determined that it needed to focus on identifying short term fixes that would prepare the website for its official release in late May, 2012. A heuristic evaluation of the current production version of the Dataone.org was conducted, as well as the alpha version of the OneMercury interface. The heuristic evaluation method was selected to inspect the site and facilitate identification of problem areas with the presentation of content and interactive functionality. The sub-group used Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics (Nielsen, J. (1994). Heuristic evaluation. In Nielsen, J., and Mack, R.L. (Eds.), Usability Inspection Methods, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY) as a guideline and inspected the site on a page by page basis capturing a list of immediate usability concerns.

Long-term goals:
Periodic ongoing assessment to improve the functionality and user experience with the DataOne and OneMercury web portals.

Scope of the Test (Mike)

The Usability analysis will focus on the DataONE.org site and its various components available by July 1, 2012. This approach is being undertaken so that the DataONE Program as a whole can be evaluated during this Usability analysis. Users will be asked to perform particular tasks and provide general impressions using all of the DataONE resources including the DataONE.org website and ONEMercury. 


Goals 

The overall goals for the Usability Analysis are:

Improve users ability to quickly find, discover, and understand DataONE Programmatic resources (i.e. Organizational structure, Working Groups, Who is involved, etc.)

Analyze users ability to navigate between DataONE Programmatic resources and DataONE Tools/Services (i.e. ONEMercury, Member Node Toolkits, etc.)

Engage the environmental science community in improving DataONE tools, services, and information to better meet community needs. 

High-levl Activities of the DataONE UA Sub-team:

Perform Heuristic analysis and summarization of DataONE.org and ONEMercury as development on these applications [portals] is in process. 

Perform formal Usablity Analysis and Testing of DataONE.org and all of its components. 

Peform data summarization of Test results in support of improving DataONE tools/services and sharing results via various publications/presentations to the DataONE organization, environmental community, and interested stakeholders. 


Review user types from personas and identify those types that have not been selected in previous rounds of testing. [??does this bias testing? do we need to identify some users for each persona, perhaps over sample in unused personas??]
ESIP attendees asked to participate in the DataOne and ONEMercury usability testing will be aligned with these targeted personas. This testing session will also provide an opportunity for the usability testing sub-group to aid in validating persona descriptions.

Testing

Before testing begins, the researchers will complete an IRB application for testing.  This IRB will be filed by the University of Tennessee research group.

An email will be sent to the ESIP community before the conference soliciting volunteers, possibly asking for particular groups of users (e.g., data managers, scientists, researchers, etc. in alignment with Personas developed).  This communication may also be advertised during the ESIP conference asking for additional users.

At least 5 participants from each user group identified will be tested.

An incentive will be offered (flash drive with DataONE logo, mousepad, candy, cookies), this will be decided at a later time (before IRB submission).

Testing will occur during the ESIP Conference.  A room will be reserved for the testing period.  The testing facilitator will setup laptops that will have the usability recording software installed (Morae).  MORAE is a software that can be used to record participants’ interaction with the website (how they locate the information), task completion, and their think-aloud data (thoughts about finding the information). MORAE recordings will be stored on the password-protected lab’s computer.

The facilitator will ask the participants to complete tasks related to the DataONE.org site and the ONEMercury Portal.  A pre- and post- questionnaire will be programmed into the software to be completed prior to and after testing.  The facilitator will be present during testing and available for any issues related to the tasks or technical problems.

The tasks will be related to finding information on the DataONE site (e.g., finding how to join a member node or best practices for data management, etc.) and the functionality of the ONEMercury Portal (e.g., finding and exporting data).

The pre-questionnaire will ask demographic questions to determine their occupation (e.g., researcher, data manager, etc.), and their self-efficacy using various databases/computer software, and the level of awareness of the participant with DataOne. 

The post-questionnaire will ask questions related to the participant's comfort with/ease of using the DataONE site and the ONEMercury portal after exposure.

After testing has ended, the facilitator will save and export the data to a password protected location (e.g., external hard drive or server space).

Data analysis timeline (Denise)
Analysis of collected data are based on phased consecutive timelines. This is due to the UT semester and introduction of a new GA for data analysis support. Timelines may be shortened if concurrent analysis is possible. Analysis is based on a pre-questionnaire, questionnaire, and post-questionnaire model of assessment..

1. Pre-questionnaires

 * limit to 3-5 questions, ask all website usability assessment participants. Analysis verbatim
   * examples (Familiarity with the DataONE.org site, Efficacy in using computers)

 * allow 2-3 weeks for review, analysis and scrubbing (Aug 10, 2012). Narrative allow 5 days (Aug 17, 2012)

2. Test questions at ESIP / DataOne Users Group - DataOne site, OneMercury portal

 * proctor/facilitator record responses, record directions/discussion during guided website review

 * verbatim analysis

 * Review, analysis and scrubbing – allow 5-6 weeks (Sept 21-28, 2012)

 * Narrative allow 10 days (Oct 12, 2012)

3. Post-questionnaires

 * proctor/facilitator records responses (?)

 * verbatim analysis
   * Examples include: Perceived complexity of the system, Ease of use, Information presentation, Information access, Features of the site
   * In addition, the participants could write down their thoughts in one open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire.

 * Review, analysis – allow 2 weeks (Oct 26, 2012)

 * Narrative allow 5 days (Nov 2, 2012)

What will be done with results:

Results from DataONE Usability testing and analysis will be shared with the DataONE Leadership Team, Cyberinfrastructure staff members, and other DataONE Working Groups. Results will also be summarized and published in appropriate scientific journals.

Report out all subgroups NOTES May 3, 2012
DataONE data principles SCWG
(5) data environment is dynamic and requires evidence-based decision-making about practice and governance
Challenges and trends - top sociocultural issues impacting DataONE:

 * advantage of reuse, collect data - stories
 * evidence from outside DataONE community that proves this
 * planning for future "uptake" at the institutional level. Work in parallel to educate, create outreach materials, answer questions about adoption ....role of usability testing in this.

Communications (SCWG)
internal communication, including MN - information transfer issues/challenges
1. implement a task management system to track quetions and action items from the WGs
2. designate one or more liaisons to facilitate internal communications (exclusive of IT/development tracking)
3. increase access/participation to Leadership Team (LT) meetings 
4. task working groups (WGs) to help support new member (individual and member node) participation.

Metrics

Theresa Pardo
Determinants of publications of scientific data in open data initiatives (student paper)
 
Sharing data enrich and promote the progress of research and generate knowledge
Data sharing – category, challenges, literature
Likelihood to share (lower cost, greater likelihood)
Dataone data used , visualizing the access pattern
Disconnected cluster indicates that a majority only access one database
Interface for depositing irrelevant – it is about behavior, trust in the system
Motive for data publication in open data initiative –theory of planned behavior
Intention correlates with action of sharing datasets, legal context impact, significance of organization support for sharing datasets, strong indirect impact of reward to the action of sharing through the intention.
