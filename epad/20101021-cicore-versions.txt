Tasks:

1. update the components in redmine
2. evaluate whether we can use relative paths for schemaLocation in .xsd docs
3. update all code to utilize the tagged version of the schemas
4. Update hudson to ensure that it is using then 
4. update all code to use the suggested package names


Comments 
- Package names should be the same as the repository folder names, which means that hyphens are not a good choice for package names.

- Need to rearrange the SVN structure
