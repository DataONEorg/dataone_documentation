Replication

Object "A", CN = "CN", MNs = "MN1", "MN2".

A is to be replicated from MN1 to MN2


CN -> MN2.replicate(CNCert, PID="A", node="MN1")

MN2: baseURL = resolve nodeId to baseURL

MN2 -> MN1.getReplica(MN2 Cert, PID="A")

  MN1 -> CN.isNodeAuthorized(MN2 subject, PID)
  
  MN1 returns "A"

MN2 -> CN.setReplicationStatus(MN2 Cert, PID="A", "Completed")

Updates to Sandbox Needed ?:

Y cn-index
Y mercury
Y cn-metacat
Y cn-os-core

Preparation for RC release next week
------------------------------------

1. Is the dev environment up-to-date with the latest snapshots as
available in the ubuntu-unstable packages?

 * Yes:
   * a few changes are needed
     * new bouncy castle
     * add security provider in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/security/java.security
     * java security extension
 * Needs testing, was deployed last night, bouncy castle issue needs to be resolved first
   * d1_integration will be used to add content to DEMOs1-4, GMNDEV

 * knb war built by hudson unstable is including multiple (4) versions of d1_common, d1_libclient
   * update:  performing the fullclean before building the war fixed the mutliple  liblclient/common_java jars being included in metacat
   * http://cn-dev.dataone.org/cn-version.html
   * http://cn-dev-2.dataone.org/cn-version.html
   * http://cn-dev-3.dataone.org/cn-version.html

2. Is the tagging complete for the latest RC?
 * remaining to be tagged:
   * d1_portal
   * d1_cn_service
   * d1_indexer
   * d1_mercury_common have been tagged including build out
   * d1_solr_extensions
   * d1_portal_servlet
   * all of level 7 (cn-buildout), except index, mercury and version tool

3. Does the following build control file have the latest version of all tags in it?

https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_stable_build_control/20120228_control.properties
Yes

4. RC versions of all Debian packages should be available in the
ubuntu-stable repo at http://dev-testing.dataone.org/ubuntu-stable
- Is that repo working out OK? Are the sandbox CNs pointing at this
repo for pulling CN Debian packages?
 * We haven't pointed the sandbox env here yet: tags first
 * Yes

5. Is the buildout process working? Is everyone OK with the unstable
and stable build process on Hudson? Any suggestions for improvement?
 * to debug any build failures, we need to have the default'String Parameter' updated to the latest tagged release in the Configuration settings of stable software packages
 * skye: suggests automating the preparation for tagging
   * not critical, but will help in the long run

6. As a general timeline (for discussion):

 * Today - we should have Dev environment running with latest snapshots.
We should also have the sandbox installed with the latest RC.
   * we'll try!

 * Next week (March 5-9) - Advertise availability of sandbox to the
DataONE leadership team plus CCIT for review during next week.
Incorporate suggestions in the unstable (trunk) in preparation for
next (hopefully final) RC.
   * confirm that all environments can communicate over each CN required TCP ports
   * 22, 443, 389, 5432, 5701, 5702

 * Week after next (March 12-16) - build out and advertise next RC for
review. Incorporate changes.

 * Week after that (March 22) - Public release on that Thursday






Robert
~~~~~~

  * finished up fixing bugs in d1_cn_rest
  * built out cn dev environment earlier this morning
  * need to add bouncyCastle to dataon-cn-os-core buildout
  * need to finish branching and tagging for next release candidate
  * need to update all poms after tagging to new snapshot level
  * need to test dev environment
  * knb buildout in unstable is very unstable

  * 

Rob
~~~
 * consolidated test output for authorization tests into 1 result per node per test
 * deployed MNWebTester containing latest libclient_java (1.0.1-RC3)
 http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080/MNWebTester_v1.0.1-RC3-SNAPSHOT_r7305/
 http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080
 * running tests against DEV environment
 * should I create a d1_integration Hudson job for SANDBOX?

Skye
~~~~
* DONE::Finalized tags for index, mercury, cn version tool components.
* DONE::Will be testing mercury3 integration with resolve endpoint and testing metadata view.
* DONE::Build search index and bring mercury3 up on all dev cn.


   * Investigating invalid xml character bug discovered during cn dev testing wednesday.
    * Added five test cases - still having issue replicating SAX parse exception for invalid xml char
    * Going to try catching sax parse exception in index processing and re-retrieve sysMeta object from
        hzcast and re-attempt with fresh copy of system metadata.
    * Need to discuss with Rob - perhaps can get the test file directly from rob.

Ben
~~~
 * DONE changed portal to be environment aware
 * DONE will be tagging portal
 * 286 objects now, can add many many more. will be getting back to KNB data loading
 * PENDING working with LTER folks to stand up an MN
 * MN IT tests now passing for Metacat deployment (demo2), including authorization (tier 2) bugs.
 * worked on a couple CN replication bugs/details with replication status.


Andy
~~~~
 * CLI is working, still testing update and resolve
 * will work with Matt on this
 * had problems with order of the DN, manually setting the rights_holder can be ambiguous, especially when the openssl tools print DNs backwards from our adopted standard
 * Working on data packaging tool.


Roger
~~~~~
 * Finished install and working on registration of GMN on mn-stage-orc-1.
 * Updated install documentation (was very outdated)


Chris
~~~~~
 * DONE troubleshooting CN Sandbox portal postrgresql session database issue
   * exception re: no acl in pg_hba.conf for 128.111.36.77, when I think there is
   * Roger can't register mn-stage-orc-1 due to lack of registered identity, troubleshooting this - need to chat with Ben
 * Was working on performance logging for when we import KNB data to the portal
   * Due to multiple CNs/JVMs/threads involved, our approach will be to parse log files
 * DONE Will upgrade the Sandbox env today once the deb packages based on tags are added to the ubuntu-stable channel
 * Thoughts on split-brain issues: Matt suggested we monitor connections on each CN, and if two are remote CNs are unreachable, shutdown services.
   * Suggestion: perhaps the easiest is just to remove firewall allow rules via ufw
 * Add the CCIT + Duane to the sandbox as identities


Matt
~~~~
 * Gave talk at NEON; received well, will likely become a MN next year; brought up issues of handling v. large data sets (e.g., their AOP effort collects 18TB raw data per day of operation)
   * Some discussion of assigning identifiers to continuous sensor streams, and data packaging

March 14th Notes
----------------

Robert
~~~~~~
 * Will work to bring Sandbox environment up with RC3 packages.
  
Skye

 * Indexing logs and reviewing for errors.  found invalid XML error. File not found errors. Maybe rebuild cn-dev.
 * Version tool command has been added to debian buildouts.
 * Coordinate with Dave what next batch of features to include in next Release.
   
Ben
~~~
 * UNM has resolved network problems.
 * Resolved MN tester bugs, metacat may be ready for a tag.
  
Andy
~~~~
 * command line interface to add packaging. discover of package document or determine if one should be built.

Roger
~~~~~
 * Replication work. Attempt to complete replication tests today.
  
Chris
~~~~~

 * Dev environment work: worked with Roger and Ben on replication issues.  Ben fixed bugs in metacat replication.
 * UNM network bouncing and created havoc in hazelcast. We have to learn how to deal with intermittant CN processing.  
 * CN dev environment seems stable network wise, probably need to upgrade all packages now.
