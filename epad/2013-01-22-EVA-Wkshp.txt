*************************************
List of ideas to come back to at the end of this EVA Workshop

Idea: 1) implementing data assimilation algortihm into ILAMB; 

Idea 2) Data assimilation models produce ensembles of model results. Having the capability to process, visualize, calculate statistics on, and evaluate that ensemble of results would be helpful.

Idea 3) Multidimensional scaling (both metric and non-metric)
***********************************

NACP:  Regional Synthesis
Matrix of model results (4 x 3 matrix of model maps):
    hard to distinguish differences
    may want to plot clusters with distances indicating degree of similarity

mean flux by biome (land cover designations)
    for a collection of different models
    
Model structure:
    how to display similarities and differences in how models represent ecosystem processes and driver data (input data)
        debbie showed tables
        
        
MsTMIP results:     
Latitudenal means (aggregating 9 model results)

hot spots of interannual variability
    pixels where the standard deviation of annual totals exceed  the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles
    use coefficient of variablity instead of percentiles?
    be nice to drill down to look at when, which models, size of the parameter (GPP, NPP, respiration, etc.)
    
Debbie's "Visualization Help"
 *     idea for how to visualize and track model structural differences
 *     visualize changes in model output (multi-model spread / agreement) with time (spatially)
 *     visualize how sensitivitiy to different drivers differs among models
 *     link differences in ouput back to model structural differences
  
  
    
    From Anna Michalak:
    Three broad types of visualization needs:
    - Scientific exploration / brainstorming, that typically require, at least at the outset, a dynamic and flexible interface (typical use: scientific discussions within group/labs/workshops)
    - Summary visualizations that can convey scientific information / conclusions in the most effective way (typical use: presentations, publications, project websites)
    - Simple (but not simplistic!) representations of broad summary information used for education, outreach, decision-support, etc. (typical use: stakeholder briefings, interdisciplinary collaborations, project websites, outreach workshops, teaching)
Additional question:
- Web-based visualization that does not require a local copy of the day, which will enable the continued use of data beyond the nominal end date of a project / funding cycle.

Jorge's Demo of UV-CDAT
Utility ideas:
-be able to load different vegetation masks, or select a specific region, that fluxes can be aggregated to...then plot time series. 
-

Jorge's talk:  http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/presentations/PDF/UVCDAT-Seminar-08.16.2012.pdf


Aritra:
toggling model structure:  
keying model structure (via colors or mouse-over highlights) to the model output (2-d projection plot & clustering)
Matrix View as a way to analyze 2 or more 2-d projection plots.
  - which models are totally/somehow similar in structure/model output


Bertram and Yaxing's talks
what could provenance do for Forrest?  System level provenance tracking to ensure that the provenance of library objects used are known and can be used in the future.  Now the provenance of these system objects are not tracked.

Note - Make API call for determining obsolescence chain available in libclient for DataONE - this is a commonly requested feature.

Note - Ensure that workflow can be stored as an object that has an identifier so that  usr may retrieve the workflow and re-use it , perhaps with different data input, and cite a workflow in publications.

Dan's Talk:
- parallelization of model analysis/visualization
- ParCAT, developed by Brian Smith at ORNL, for parallel processing netcdf-based datasets, writtern in C, uses pnetCDF and MPI

Dan's Needs:  parallel easy-to-use framework for interactive, reproducible visualizaiton and diagnostics, scalable to big data

Dan's Demo: EDEN

Forrest's presentation, Data Mining for Climate Change Model Intercomparison, is available here: http://www.climatemodeling.org/~forrest/presentations/Hoffman_DataONE-EVA_20130122/

EVA:  Ideas for collaboration (Claudio)
1.  machine learning and visualization interactions
     Forrest Hoffman and Bill Hargrove
     Jorge, Harish, Claudio, Vineet, Arthur
     
     build on President's big data initiative
    
    
    
2.  Evaluation/Review of visualization techniques for climate community experts
     Aritra leads, with volunteers
         Anna, Debbie, Steve, Yaxing, Dan Ricciuto, Forrest, Claudio
         
         need to bring in Rosie and Dave Lawrence Via Steve Aulenbachj
         
     usability assessment for various visualization techniques, pros & cons for them
        pull together wide range of figures / maps / etc and get expert community input on utility
        
    contribution to show how visualization maps / figures have improved through interaction and collaboration with vis group
    
    need to have collaborations between modelers and visualization experts throughout the activity, for different types of audience/purposes (3 different types needs mentioned in Anna's notes)
    
        history of how climate data have been presented
            based on IPCC reports 
    
    IPCC Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability) technical support unit (TSU) :  Located at Carnegie and Anna can coodinate with them if there is interest in learning from their experience.
    Anna: How broad is the evaluation/review scope defined? Scientifc audience only? We may need the contribution from social science people by doing surveys.
    
    
    
3. (Maybe) another paper focusing on the visualization needs of policy makers.
    need to engage resource managers / social scientists to identify types of analysis and visualizations

    Anna, Arthur, Debbie, Bill, Steve Aulenbach, Jeff Morisette (??), 

    may be of use for farmers and commerical fisheries (those who use natural resources)

    involve Molly Brown, Molly McCoy
    Jeff Morrisete:  USGS 
    National Climate Assessment  GCIS
    NOAA Socio-Economic Climate Group (Boulder) 
    
    
4. A working group/focus group/proposal on the visualization needs for multiple-dimensional  Scaling
    metric and non-metric

place a group of (1) models or  (2) models and observations in the same phase space for intercomparison

    potential method for looking at ILAMB processes
    
    Vineet, Debbie, Bill Hargrove, Anna?, Jorge, Claudio

Anna: I am potentially interested in topics 2, 3, and 4, but in the interest of not spreading myself too thin, feel free to down-select me to one or two topics depending on the needs / interests of others in the room.    
    
5. (Day 2) Expand on the DataONE Provenance-Workflow (VisTrails) demo (Yaxing et al) to show DataONE tool & infrastructure integration

lead by Prov / Workflow Working Group, tie in to the EVA WG
Bertram and Yaxing and Colin
link to Brokering approach (Stefano Nativi, Italian National Research Counsil)
prehaps prepare for demo-ing at the NSF reverse site visit on February 

Build a common infrastructure  with Vistrails/UV-CDAT as the fundamental engine that can integrate difference components together: DataONE, broker, scientific workflow, provenance

Summer internships:
    use for EVA activities (above)


Key Future Issues that need to be addressed
1.  Common problem with large data sets:
    move the data to where the model is (and vice versa)
    a concept that needs to be included as we work through the above five identified issues

2.  Model compositing:  averaging across models
    figure out how to composite models that are similar, especially for resource managers / policy makers / decision makers
    too many projects are averaging models
    
    need to come up with some best practices (because there are some that aren't good at all)
    is there a weighting method, that could weight bad less than good
    tools / methods that are a better approach for looking at ensembles
    

*** DAY 2 ***
=========
- Presentation by Colin (?) on use of VisTrails
- Bertram: This might make a nice example for an "executable paper"; suggest to  check with Juliana
- Q (Arthur): I have a bunch of Python-based workflows, how can I get them easily into VisTrails (at least some of them)
 - A: ... 
 
 Benchmarking
 
 ILAMB Talk -- Forrest
 
 exploratory vis to determine scoring profiles / algorithms
 
 also after the fact exploratory viz to change weightings to adjust for where model works well or doesn't work well.
 
Forrest's presentation, The International Land Model Benchmarking Project (ILAMB), is available here: http://www.climatemodeling.org/~forrest/presentations/Hoffman_DataONE-EVA_20130123.pdf
 
 MsTMIP Talk on Benchmarking -- Christopher

-- Benchmarks (ILAMB, MsTMIP)

* Central piece: 
-- WF library (Analysis Modules, Vis Modules)
-- on top of VisTrails, UV-CDAT
-- on top of model outputs, observations, ... 
-- ... mediated by "brokers" (?)

* Vertical (left)
- ESGF, DataONE (again, via brokers)

Discussion of MMIF
    adding functionality to UV-CDAT for exploratory analysis visualization
    evaluation  of different approaches for benchmarking (spatial, temporal, weighting, parameters, data sets, etc.)

Vineet Yadav:  SI2 Talk
too much time spent processing data :  roughly 50% of the time



*************************************************** 
End of EVA Workshop Discussion

Five groups to look at model-model intercomparisons (first day)

1.  machine learning and visualization interactions
     Forrest Hoffman, Bill Hargrove, Jorge, Harish, Claudio, Vineet, Arthur, Christopher

    new visualization methods for model evalutations (CMIP5)
    based on Forrrest's and Bill's past work
    agnostic as far as tools to be used
    
    machine learning approach:  
            for different models, use small number of clusters
            for models that are different may want to use a large number of clusters
            
       Harish as the coordinator
       use a series of teleconferences to develop a plan built on Forrests' and Bill's efforts
       Doodle poll to optimize time for telecon
                
2.  Evaluation/Review (usability assessment) of visualization techniques for climate community experts
     Aritra leads, with  Anna, Debbie, Steve, Yaxing, Dan Ricciuto, Forrest, Christopher, Claudio, Bob

    develop talk for NACP meeting during week of February 4, based on Aritra's talk yesterday
    model intercomparison:  same output from multiple models and multiple outputs from a single model
    
    identify visualizations used by climate scientists and develop a method for evaluating the visualizations
    
Are we talking just about visualizations in publications, or also animations / visualizations on websites etc.?  In other words, are we just talking about static material, or also dynamic material?  Both static and dynamic
    
    need to identify types of assessment tools used for dynamic and static visualizaitons
    
    how to use exploratory / interactive visualizaitons to facilitate / improve analysis 
   
    history of how climate data have been presented
            based on IPCC reports 
    
    IPCC Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability) technical support unit (TSU) :  Located at Carnegie and Anna can coodinate with them if there is interest in learning from their experience.


    develop survey questions appropriate for climate modeling experts (e.g., top 3 / worst 3)   
    link to DataONE Usability and Assessment Working Group


teleconferences to develop a plan for the paper
    target date of September 2013



3. (Maybe) another paper focusing on the visualization needs of policy makers.
 * need to engage resource managers / social scientists to identify types of analysis and visualizations

    Anna, Arthur, Debbie, Bill, Steve Aulenbach, Jeff Morisette (??), 

    idea to defer to a later time
    
    narrow the scope to be manageable
    perhaps through a series of case studies
        1.  fire visualization case study (Nancy French, Tyler Erickson, and Arthur Endsley)
            focus on lessons learned
        
Web-based visualization of fire data, work done by a project of Nancy French, provides some visualization  scenarios for resource managemers / decision-makers / policy makers..

Development of decision products for spatial quantification of carbon emissions from wildfires for North America: http://mtri.org/fire.html
        
Wildland Fire Emissions Information System: http://wfeis.mtri.org/
 
        2. Climate model output for resource managers / decision makers -- Case Studies
                Jeff Morisette
                consensus of scientific results needs to be conveyed
                coherence of results
            this topic is broad, but could be focussed by looking at specific resources being managed
            resource users:  commercial fisheries, forestry, public lands, agriculture
        
        <<Taccimo --USFS tool to help foresters bring climate change results into their plans / decisions
                decisions can be controversial and sometimes are debated in legal system>>
        
        
4. A working group/focus group/proposal on the visualization needs for multiple-dimensional  scaling
    metric and non-metric

 * place a group of (1) models or  (2) models and observations in the same phase space for intercomparison
 * potential method for looking at ILAMB processes
    
    Vineet, Debbie, Bill Hargrove, Anna, Jorge, Yaxing, Forrest, Christopher

    Vineet:  will examine the model structural binary data 
        
    not sure what will become of this one
    this is a pilot study that may build into a larger activity, perhaps even a proposal
    
    comparison studies
    chocolate chip example: 
        use a variety of recipes to produce cookies, then have tasters evaluate the cookies
        use multi-dimensional analysis to show the mix of ingredients that this group would most like, even
      though that one cookie was not baked
    
    congressional voting records as another example
    
    low probably of success, but huge payoff if successful
    
5.  (Day 2) Pilot Prototyping of "Provenance-aware Model Exploration, Evaluation, and Benchmarking Cyber-infrastructure"
     expand on the DataONE Provenance-Workflow (VisTrails) demo (Yaxing et al) to show DataONE tool & infrastructure integration
lead by EVA Working Group, tie in to the Prov / Workflow Working Group and UV-CDAT group
Bertram, Yaxing, Colin, Jorge, Aritra, Christopher,  Steve, ProvWG members (Victor, ... ), Dave Vieglais

demo for the reverse site visit in February
Prov Post Doc to present the demo in two weeks

Lead:  Yaxing and Victor

Yaxing would like to lead some follow-on activities to go beyond the coming DataONE-EVA-ProvWG demonstration to do some prototyping based on the "Provenance-aware Model Exploration, Evaluation, and Benchmarking Cyber-infrastructure" concept. He treats this prototype as a pilot that may leads to a future Model Benchmarking Framework proposal, as listed in "Benchmarking activities" bullet below.
Plans:
Stage 1: 
   1) Extract several components from the MsTMIP benchmarking profile and implement VisTrails modules and workflows
   2) Identify and implement core analysis modules to support the pilot benchmarking prototype in 1)
   3) Based on the visualization needs evaluation results from group 2 and 4, choose and implement several visualization techniques as VisTrails modules and put them on top of workflows implemented in 1).
   4) Build prototype web-based user interface
Stage 2:
   1) Integrate the prototype with DataONE infrastructure
   2) Bring in provenance-aware tools developed by DataONE ProvWG into this big picture.

    protyping and testing by Yaxing, Jorge, Aritra, Steve, Christopher, and/or summer interns
    using the MsTMIP profile

link to expert evaluation of model visualizations (item 2) and multidimensional scaling (item 4)

evaluate management aspects and values of provenance querying
value added 

Products:  
1) paper based on the coming DataONE_CI-EVA-ProvWG demo (end of spring: March?)
2) prototype implementation, as described above (may leverage resources from DataONE summer project)
3) proposal on Multi-model intercomparison Framework (Fall? to flesh out the prototype tools)


Benchmarking activity
1.  Multi-model intercomparison Framework (MMIF)

Yaxing, Aritra, Jorge, Christopher, Anna, Debbie, Forrest, Bob, Ben Burnett....Bertram (to add provenance)
Christopher:  lead

    pilot activity UV-CDAT
        connection to group 4's activity (pilot protyping)
        
        need to develop a list of features for the pilot and the proposal
              
    proposal writing
        tied to functionality and specific solicitation
            DOE BER
            NSF SI2:  released, should check timing / dates
            
        close collaboration with ILAMB, MsTMIP, CMIP5
