Agenda for 2013-01-25 (11:00 MST - 11:30 MST)

1) CI Update (Vieglais)
Developers working through testing v1.1; likely to be pushed out tonight / tomorrow.  Main concern is ensuring full back-ups are maintained.
Some bad news - first incidence of machine hacking on Wednesday.  Very peripheral machine so doesn't appear to be an impact on DataONE itself.  Machine was used for monitoring so not integral to operations.  Recovery straight forward and should be up and running by end of weekend.

Q: WM: How was machine hacked?  DV: Procedure is to isolate machine after hack and different group are doing the forensics.  Don't know outcome yet.
Q: JC: Might be worth asking the forensics team where the infection came from (e.g. if it is associated with another DataONE machine).
Q: JC: Update risk register item arising from this?  DV: Will take a look.

Next week CCIT & Devs meet in SB.  preparing for RSV and some triage on time taken to push out v1.1.
Demo prep looking good; Morpho to be released before RSV. Lagging on ONEDrive implementation but will be in demo-able prototype state.  Other big topic for CCIT meeting is to plan for remainder of funding cycle.

Q: WM: Is Feb 8th a realistic date for Dryad to come online? DV: Yes, seems reasonable.  TV: Need to address an issue of dealing with versioning and mutability.  DV: There is a plan in place for this.  To be disucssed at CCIT next week.


2) MN Update (Cobb)
1) Good MN prioritization work at the RSV prep meeting.
Also a good place to visually see the prioiritization is via a Redmine backlog view
<https://redmine.dataone.org/rb/master_backlog/mns>
        - still need to place 10 operational MN's in the list
        - will move 

2) Continue to prep for MN "office hours"
        soliciting a better name than "office hours" 
        Will launch in Feb., but will grow more later

3) Looking for contacts with more prospective node. Some timely items:
        EDAC node: Well on the way, but it is high profile item for the RSV
        Dryad: looking to tie items up and finish testing/deployment. It is looking closer
        NKN and USGS regional climate centers
        SEAD
        USGS Topo maps - editing API may work well with DataONE; May also harvest into           existing USGS MN and serve through that...(MIKE)
        Continue contact with PELD in Brazil. Current issue is "spin-off" authority
        

3) CEE Update (Budden)
Internship proposals due MONDAY (http://bit.ly/W0RMUE)
Volunteer requested for internship committee - Suzie able to help but not lead.  Bill can also assist.
Newsletter deadlines to be extended further into March due to RSV prep.

4) Reverse Site Visit (Michener) - Full Day Feb 28 ; Ending at NOON March 1. 
Team to be available in DC on 27th for run through.
Need to submit agenda to NSF - therefore may yet change a little (currently 8.25 hours without time for lunch/breaks)
Materials have to be sent to NSF Feb 13th.  Briefing package to include presentations; Thanos report; proposal; pmp; higher level overview of project, CI and CE; publications,

John Kunze: I presented on a dataset discovery panel (webinar) yesterday with Mary Vardigan (ICPSR), Michael Diepenbroek (PANGAEA), and Nigel Robinson (Thomson Reuters).  326 participants.  Talking to SDSC and Microsoft about DataUp development possibilities.  Any news on DataUp supplemental funding?

Todd: nothing here

Bruce: Nothing beyond what's already been discussed.
