Agenda:

Lee update current status:  
 * Got test member node set up and able to add documents to server and they propagate.
   * https://mynpn-dev.usanpn.org/knb/metacat/USANPN4.5.0/default
 * Plan to start with annual data sets, grabbed from the data download tool, sample is on the development server.  
 * Need to generate test certificate.  Test MN is using a self-signed cert for authentication.  Ticket has been created for a certificate https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/3966.  
 * Production server shouldn't be too much work.  Server is already up with most of the software stack.  Needs PostgreSQL and necessary WAR files.  Will need a production client certificate --&&&&& Need to create the ticket for this.  
 * Metacat DataONE screen will generate the necessary manifest XML file for registering the production MN.  But needs the client certificate for this screen.  
 * Lee working with Erin Posthumus to get the EML template updated to use the fields to describe the fields in the data file.  
 * Lee needs to get the DOI's from EZID for the production datasets.  Basic plan is to get the data sets into production using Metacat-generated ID's.  Can update the production datasets later with the DOI's once the datasets are in production and stable.  DOI's do not need to be a critical path item for getting the USA-NPN MN operational.  Note that the account with EZ ID needs to be done by the institution (such as U AZ or OALS -- Office of Arid Land Studies).
 * Next telecon 10/16 15:00 EDT, 12:00 PDT.  Bruce to set up GTM for this



    Recap:
   * NPN wishes to operate at tier 1 and that they are in a position to establish a test system.
   * Based  on NPN's "live" data status, we think we'll have one dataset that's historic wildlife data, others by year.  Alyssa said they'd work on PIDs/DOIs with Bruce.
   * Alyssa indicated that the due date shown on the redmine ticket of 31 Oct 2013 is reasonable.


    Questions from NPN that DataONE can address?
