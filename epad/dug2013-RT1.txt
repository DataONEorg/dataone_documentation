Talking points / Guiding Questions
 * What are the main challenges?
 * What solutions currently exist?
 * What contribution can / should DataONE provide in this landscape?  How can that be best achieved?

Main Challenges
 * Time (available to researchers)
 * Short-term and long-term goals
 * Storage
   * inadequate amounts
   * with permissions
   * with access fo rmultiple institutions
   * cloud problematic for state institutions
   * policies
 * Adoption/prioritization
   * DM buy-in
 * Policy compliance
 * Data quality and assurance (QA/QC)
 * Lack of expertise
   * researchers
 * Standardization versus customization
   * data formats
   * data delivery
 * Ethical and privacy issues
   * Issues with the privacy policy changing in middle of the "game"
 * Data rescue (for orphaned data)
 * Collaboration
   * Issues with tenure and promotion conflicts
 * Data "ownership"
   * Responsibility for managing data
   * Chain of custody (e.g., students need to hand off data)
 * Regulation
 * Dark archives: who curates data that is no longer 'claimed'
 * Intellectual property 
   * International differences in laws regarding data
   * Commercial data
 * Ongoing tasks
   * During project execution
     * versioning
   * After handoff to a repository
     * e.g., media migration, format migration, etc.
 * Risk management
   * Manage data as an asset of an institution
 * Geospatial issues
   * Re-engineering of data, modeling of data
 * Data collection/acquisition
   * Sensor software stacks
   * Proprietary technologies
   * Heterogeneity of formats, schemas, etc.
 * Lack of data interoperability
 * Communications issues
   * Between libraries and researchers
 * Metadata
   * Conflict of time interests between producers and consumers
 * Money (or lack thereof)

Solutions
 * Education
   * best practices
   * think ahead to when you will be a data consumer (what will you need)
   * think ahead to where you will deposit your data
 * Automate systems
   * Automatic metadata creation
   * Makes it more efficient, reduces time conflicts
   * Embed best practice in workflow
   * Have instruments automatically produce metadata in data streams
   * Use workflow software (e.g., Taverna Workbench, Kepler, etc.) for automation
 * Create {Funder/Journal/Student} Mandates for data/metadata provision
   * Increases participation
   * Requires agreement on best practices that are mandated
 * Create Best practices
   * Vary with domain
 * Use collaboration software (e.g., HubZero)
   * Can help in embedding standards and best practices in collaboration environments
 * Break down institutional walls to collaboration
   * Align research agendas and institutional agendas
 * Create clear institutional policies
   * Inform institutions of the need for clear policies
 * Shared data sharing and authorship policies for collaborators
 * DM Operational plan which is more detailed than the two-pager in the proposal
 * Work with data sharing "champions"
 * Collection building software
   * DSpace, Fedora, iRods, Metacat, GMN, DataVerse, Omeka, etc.
 * Create interoperability among repository platforms
   * iRods
 * Include funds for DM in grant budgets
   * Also focus on mechanisms to reduce costs
 * Incentives for (better) data management
   * Subsidized storage for good behavior
 * Evaluation and assessment
   * Which projects are doing "good" data management

DataONE contributions
 * Money?
 * Building best practices and training resources
 * ** Exemplar cases/case studies of projects doing DM well (and poorly, yikes!)
   * Show impact that it has
   * e.g., DataONE "Data stories" showing impact
   * Ability for commentary on the case studies/forum
   * * Show code and data (extracts) as part of case studies
 * * Work on shared investigator tools (ITK)
   * Can produce good practice
   * Can produce good metadata
   * Tools are the hooks between researchers and DM practice
 * Reach out to private groups like companies
 * Cyberinfrastructure for interoperability among "MN"s
   * MN connections
 * Advocacy
   * Promotion of Investigator Toolkit tools
   * Dissemination
   * Policy issues
   * National support for infrastructure
   * Help community respond to requests for comments on national policies, etc.
 * DataONE Case studies showing societal relevance of DM
   * e.g., climate change, etc.
   * showing broader impacts of data management
 * Provide forum for shared solutons to DM issues
   * Work with similar groups: Duraspace, Open Repositories, Digital Library Foundation (DLF)
 * ** Provide Registry and evaluation of tools
   * Provide ability for users to provide tool evaluations (+1, comments, reviews), searchable, dynamic
     * Like a DataBib/R3Data for tools
   * Libraries and research groups can use to evaluate approaches
 * * Provide file formats and metadata standards recommendations
   * Pros and cons of each
   * Crowdsource feedback on these as well
