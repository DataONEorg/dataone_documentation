Should we set up a Google Hangouts for those who cannot travel to the WG meeting?

2.  Visualization Critique and Visualization Best Practices - Aritra and Claudio
    - Goal:     
    - critically evaluate maps, scatter plots, and line plots from existing papers 
    - categorize the types of issues found and place into a taxonomy
    - develop better charts that convey the same intent, but are more pleasing visually
    - devise a list of best practices for visualizaing data that can be used by carbon modelers
    
    - Describe the methodology of the study in Aritra's manuscript
    - Describe the taxonomy of design problems
    - Pick a few example figures from existing literatures, apply the above taxonomy to identify their problems, propose improvement solutions, and ask feedbacks from climate scientists (agree or disagree)
