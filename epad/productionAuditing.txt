Content Auditing
=============
ToDos: 
1. draft a user case for CN consistency auditing
2. draft a use case for synchronization auditing

3. implement checksum recalculating tool
4. 







~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Content Auditing includes:
CN consistency auditing - do all of the CNs have a common view of the collection?
replication auditing - (use case 9) do all of the objects contain the 'right' number of replicas, (in theory and practice)?
synchronization auditing - have all of the objects on the MNs been synchronized?
data integrity auditing - (use case 25) - periodic recalculation of checksums on objects.

and maybe:
collection inventory - do 'extra' copies of data objects on MNs not listed as replicas exist?
duplicate detection - do identical but unrelated documents exist?


CN Consistency
------------------------
Dataone needs to perform periodic content auditing to check that system metadata is consistent between all of the Coordinating Nodes.

From Dave's email:
"The issues recently encountered with the CN inconsistencies suggest
fairly strongly that we need to address the auditing capabilities on
the CNs much sooner than anticipated. "

"So I think you, Chris B, and Robert and Ben will need to work together to
outline a set of tools and capabilities that are needed for the
auditing work."

"These tools will need to report in a way that can be viewed by people
but also can be used to drive other tools that need to be written,
that will correct issues identified in the verification process."


Set of tools needed for auditing
---------------------------------------------
1. verify sysmeta is consistent across CNs - 
2. verify sysmeta is consistent with the source (authoritative MN) - new tool compareSysmetaToSource created
3. verify content:
    - retrievable from all replicas
    - the "checksum etc." is correct
    
4. ??








Set of capabilities needed for auditing
-------------------------------------------------------
1. read-only client?  (to make sure we aren't adding anything other than log READ events to the system) - done
2. faster https client - for multiple requests to the same node
3 consistent slicing from the CN.




Notes:
=======

CN api methods that are relevant:
listObjects - creates ObjectList from systemMetadata table in metacat database
getSystemMetadata - gets the smd from Hazelcast SystemMetadataMap
describe - derives the DescribeResponse from Hazelcast SystemMetadataMap
resolve - calls metacat getSystemMetadata 
getLogRecords - EventLog
get - returns the inputStream from MetacatHandlers.read method:
    /** 
    * Read a document from metacat and return the InputStream.  The XML or
    * data document should be on disk, but if not, read from the metacat database.
    */
