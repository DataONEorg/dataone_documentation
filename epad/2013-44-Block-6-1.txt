Sprint Planning
---------------

 * D1 Dashboard
   * Beta Version. Significant changes due to evaluation at AHM. Most cosmetic changes have been made. Time series graph models need information from Log Aggr (Robert dependency). Chris B working on map. Need minimal version of Dashboard on Prod 'fairly soon', as in yesterday.
 * Implementing Mutability
   * Ongoing discussion. Completing evaluation of the SID approach.
 * Network changes at UCSB
   * Complete
 * MN documentation
   * Complete. (now in maintenance mode, where spot improvements are happening as needed).
 * MN rollouts
   * GOA, NPN, SEAD complete
   * KUBI: In progress.
   * EDAC: in testing phase.  delays due to stage environment problems, encountering subtle behavior issues with listObjects and value of obsoletedBy field.
