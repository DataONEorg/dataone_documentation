Poster Feedback
Globe
 * More MNs (by year? by status?)
 * Remove lines
 * Logos - represent MNs, have logos representing community

General
 * Section off in a way that tells a story
 * Reduce text within the principal components to just single sentences
 * Retain all four elements
 * Put DLC in center and use as a unifying theme - radiate to elements that are currently in the  poster
 * Use more color in the DLC

Brochure Feedback
 * Needs work

Bookmark
 * Left justified font on back
 * Doesn't speak to DataONE on the front page.  Butterflies and inverts is a sterotyped version of ecology, other icons?
 * Data shouldn't disapear, have it blossoming?  have it transitioning into a visualization
 * Enhanced research rather than efficient research
 * Science preservation rather than Enhanced science
 * Just have the logo sideways on the front
 * Trisha to coordinate generating the test
 * Create two front designs

FACT Sheet
 * Have a MN specific box on the generic FACT sheet?
 * Do we need FACT sheets?

Example FACT sheets required
1) How to become a Member Node (with examples)
2) Why join the DataONE Users group?
3) How does a sponsor benefit by becoming involved with DataONE?

Need to distill our message down to our brand "DataONE" and invest in the final materials that people will be viewing - the website.

Postcard?

Prioritization
Bookmark - first
Brochure - second
Postcard - third

Actions (in order of priority):
1) Finish poster - work with Steve and Will Morris on concpetual redesign.
2) Create two bookmarks for either printing or voting in advance of upcoming meetings
3) Continue design process for brochure.  Time constraint removed since these materials may not be neccesary for meetings but online printing.
