DataONE Four Principles
1. Data should be part of the permanent scholarly record and requires long-term stewardship.
2. Sharing and reuse maximize the value of data to environmental science. 
3. Environmental science is best served by an open and inclusive global community.
4. The data environment is dynamic and requires evidence-based decision-making about practice and governance.

DATAONE ALL HANDS MEETING 2013:  SOCIOCULTURAL ISSUES WORKING GROUP

---------------------------------------------ORGANIZATIONS---------------------------------------------
Cyberinfrastructure or other organizations more broadly?
Scale: how do we compare ourselves?
Public organization
Private organizations
Community focused organizations
Best practices for communities
Mission-driven organizations
Scholarly focus
Not for profit organizations
Project versus organization: when is there a transition
Sustainability? 
Do we look at our scope as those projects that morphed into organizations?
Let's be sure to include some organizations that started as projects.


Structural
  How it is arranged (WGs?)
    Governance structure
  Do they hold data?
  How long assembled? 
    Where assemble?
  How long operational?
  Strategic preplanning and planning
  Public or private support
  Communication tools
  Communication policy
  Sustainability plan
  Mission/vision
  Aspect of the Data LifeCycle
    Financial support
    Budget
  Proposal vs implementation
  Authorized users
    Internal/external evaluation 
  Technologies used (analyze these features in Technology sub-  group) & will integrate
    Relationship to DataONE
    
Human Resources
  Paid, unpaid volunteers
  Strategic partners and other stakeholders
  How members are selected
    Expectations of users

Symbolic
  Name of organization
  How members are selected (status?) 
  Building trust
    Branding/marketing
  Features in high profile publications



>ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp 
 * "A partner in social science research"
 *  Provides leadership and training in data access, curation, and analysis for social science research community.
 * Maintains a data archive.

*> DuraSpace (http://www.duraspace.org/)

> AHDS Arts and Humanities Data Service http://www.ahds.ac.uk/ - failed when they lost their funding

> arXiv.org - membership, looked at users and determined top 20 institutions, went to them and said you should give us money bc your researchers use us.  

> ORCID (http://orcid.org/)

*> FigShare http://figshare.com 
 * a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner.

> NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis) http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/
 * Advancing  ecology to improve lives and the environment by workign to make it more  collaborative, open, integrated, relevant adn technologically informed.
 * research center at UC Santa Barbara

Wednesday:  Discussed the idea that membership models are among the most common (successful?) models in the projects we are reviewing.  however, we wonder, ultimately, is the membership model, as it proliferates, creates a new industry of membership based data projects which then creates a burden on users/libraries to join any number of such organizations.  Is there a difference between what a library, or member, would pay to join all these organizations vs. how much it costs to provide them?  (miriam trying to capture discussion, may not be completely correct.  Ahrash could state better.)







Project versus organization
Address one audience at a time
SImple branding
"Scientists sharing science data"
Agilty -- transitions in governance, structure 
Actionable vs. learning style home page (function of home page)


LESSONS LEARNED

From ICPSR - longevity.  organization vs. project.  

From Figshare - agility, youthful, clear, up and coming.  home page wants you to do something.  symetry to everything we do.  

From NCEAS - 

From Arts org - make sure you offer something that is not replicated by member nodes.  Diversify funding sources. 

questions:
what can a scientist do when they come to dataone home page?  Discovery, learn, it's not deposit.   what should they be able to do?  Deposition is not easy and is done through MNs NOT DataONE.  DISCOVERY ACROSS MNs is DataONE.  Education is DataONE.  Data sharing is DataONE.  Best practices is DataONE. 

What do we (SCWG) want to share with DataONE/Leadership Team out of this meeting?  We have 5 hours left.  

Commonalities
 * tiered membership with free discoverability - what do we lose when some people can't pay?
