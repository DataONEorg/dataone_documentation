Should node subject be the node identifier? Nope. Certificates expire, may be multiple subjects associated with a node.

what is the max length of the string? 25 characters (policy limit)
ldap: 256 chars (functional limit)
Case: character case is important.  urn:node:UCSBCN <> urn:node:ucsbcn But be careful of approving IDs to avoid "case squatting"
NodeIds across environments: OK, but discouraged. A BaseURL must not appear in more than one environment

Definition:
NodeReference = "urn ":" node ":" id
urn           = "urn"
node          = "node"
id            = *( unreserved )
unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"

Tasks: 
Matt- update architecture doc
Robert - update LDAP schema
Robert - accept nodeID provided in the node document during registration
