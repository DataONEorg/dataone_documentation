3. November 1 LT Meeting agenda (http://tiny.cc/g5p68)

4. Round the room (All)

Usability & Assessement Co-chairs developed an Agenda for the All-Hands Meeting in November.   The approach is to continue and complete some of the sub group activities that were began at the last All Hands meeting.   The UA Co-chairs did suggest that a joint sessions with CCIT and other working groups would be held at the All Hands related to the Investigator Toolkit vision.  UA will also be meeting with the Socio Cultural WG at the All Hands.    

UA will be posting the Baseline Assessment Survey results in the DataONE Collaboration area for those interested.   DataONE should figure out where to put this data for public viewing, when it is appropriate.    

UA is beginning to work on the Librarian Assessment.

PostDoc in support of UA is being Announced next week.   

Sociocultural WG co-chairs developed their agenda for the All-Hands Meeting in November.  Potential deliverables were identified during the Sept conference call with members , concentrating specifically on items that will be useful for the DUG in December.   SC co-chairs suggested aligning some blocks with U&AWG and a larger group meeting in Block 9 with S&G WG, and the CE WGs that are in attendance. 

John: EVA proceeding with good results and used most of the allocation on Lonestar
writing larger allocation for next quarter;

Bob:  Assessement for our Best Practices workshop has been closed.  We had 18 participants respond before the workshop and 11 after.

Dave Vieglais is visiting ORNL on Monday & Tuesday next week to discuss the Coordinating and Member nodes at Oak Ridge, tools, and TeraGrid.
