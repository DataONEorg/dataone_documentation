DataONE Animations Discussion
Paul Allen and Bob Sandusky
August 18, 2010

General goals for animations
 * Animations  should be understandable by anyone interested in DataONE: domain  scientists, administrators, NSF program officers, librarians, social  scientists, computer scientists
   * avoid information overload or excessive technical detail
 * Animations should be short: less than 3 minutes long
 * Animations should have narration and be captioned
 * Animations should be consistent with the technical implementation
 * Animations should express what is implemented, what is to be implemented in a  future milestone, and be clearly labeled as to what version of the  DataONE architecture they represent
 * What are the target presentation environments? PowerPoint?YouTube?

Process
1. select a process to represent or a question to address
2. storyboard the animation - bring in visual designer at this point
3. review with CCIT
4. revise and vet
5. produce animation using a visually talented person

Reference Draft Architecture Sketches

Ideas for key questions/processes to be documented:

 * What does it mean for my repository to become a member node?
   * What do I have to implement?
     * increasing levels of D1 "compliance"
   * What additional services can I then offer my clientele?
     * replication/preservations
   * Will my present identifier scheme work with D1?
   * Are member nodes assimilated into D1?
   * What happens when a member node fails or is dismantled?

 * Scientist  point of view (data producer) - potentially the first to be produced
   * three types of scientists
     * already associated with a MN
     * already associated with a data repository/network 
     * scientist, unaffliated with any data repository/network
   * Where does my data go?
     * How is my data replicated? (split off into separate technical detail)
     * Preservation
   * Where does my metadata go?
     * What metadata does D1 support?
     * What minimal set of fields must I provide?
   * What control do I have over my data in D1?
   * Data usage reporting
   * Other value added
     * data access control (future)
   * What happens when I enhance, correct, or add to my data?
     * principal of immutability

 * How does D1 benefit scienctists in domain X? (data consumer)
   * Discovery 
     * How do scientists locate data
   * Retrieval
   * data integration (future capability)
   * Investigator Toolkit Integration

 * What is the Investigator Toolkit (ITK)?
 * 
 * What is a data scientist?

 * Core D1
   * services offered
     * registration of data
     * search/discovery
     * preservation (oversee replication of data)
     * federated identity
     * usage logging
     * node/system health monitoring
     * 

 * Coordinating Nodes - technical details
   * software stack
   * syncrhonication of metadata
   * indexing of metadata and search
   * system metadata

 * Member Nodes - technical details
   * implementation examples
     * software stacks used
   * data replication process
     * 

 * Technical Research Issues in D1 Implementation
   * semantically-facilitated data integration

 * Roadmap
   * What will be forthcoming from DataONE?
   * At v1.0 release?
   * Beyond v1.0 release
   * data subsetting
   * semantic search
   * semantically-facilitated data integration
   * data/metadata validation
   * data/metadata format migration
   *

Plan D1 animations for AHM
2010-10-15: Allen, Sandusky
2010-10-21: Allen, Budden, Sandusky

Prior to meeting
1. write 1-2 sentence descriptions of existing animation ideas (including the intended audience) - Bob
  Budden: will provide list of scenarios generated by EAB
2. distribute on paper in materials distributed at the meeting
3. check whether laptops will be allowed/encouraged at the AHM
4. create short PPT (Paul)
5. draft the script (Bob)
6. Create blank storyboard pages for BOF (Bob)

Part 1- At the plenary (12 minutes if the animation has already been shown, or 15 if we need to show it):
1.       show the animation (if it hadn’t been shown yet; use a downloaded copy)
2.       describe the process 
2a.       for gathering additional ideas (de-emphasize idea generation)
2b.      for using a (BOF?  Breakout?) session to get storyboards /outlines /scripts started
2c.       for producing the animation, very briefly
2d.      possibly show the first and the last version of the storyboard for the finished animation (so people get a better idea of the process.
3. Emphasize that this is not a technical task

Ideas for step 2a (de-emphasize): 
·         individual sheets of paper
·         an EtherPad
·         poster sheets on walls

Part 2 - (60 minutes) At the actual work session we envision:
1.       recap the production process, in more detail if necessary
a.       show the first and the last version of the storyboard for the finished animation
2.       choosing which story ideas to push forward (method TBD)
3.       breaking into small groups, one per idea / scenario
4.       providing blank storyboard sheets for people to work with
5.       enable people to continue to work on their scenarios

Resources: Looks likely that DataONE can contract out for animation productions. Need specs to select someone. Need estimate of hours needed to produce one. Don't have an estimate on adding the narration.
