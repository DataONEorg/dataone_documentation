Action items from last time:
    Laura to follow up with Debora Drucker from PPBio - last conversation with Debora, they were trying to get everyone "together" as they are spread out, many in the field, etc.

Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions
    
1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
    Nothing going on right now.
    CCIT meeting coming up week of 9/22/13; if there is anything that any MNs would like for Bruce to bring up at that meeting, let him know here/now.
   
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.

 * Mike's (PISCO) upgrade to new version of metacat - how's it going re: the indexing problem?  Also, how about the MatLab playing well with DataONE issue?
   * 20K record index difference between local node and CN index, Mike correcting
   * MatLab and D1: Java version issue, can change version in MatLab but causes its own set of problems
     * Dave: which version of Java
     * Mike: ver 1.6 in "newer" MatLab, even older for the 2008-2009 versions of MatLab
     * Mike documenting, Chris (et al) have access to it
     * Dave: we have plans to move to current version of Java in the next several months, which may compound this issue
     * Mike: hasn't seen any issues on Macs, just PCs and Linux which uses own version of Java


3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:

Mike: one thing I'm seeing with the indexing thing is too many open files errors; is there any information available on how to run this new version of metacat
Dave: we do make changes on CNs to enable them to handle the volume; will check with Chris to see what settings are  (Dave to get back with Mike)
Mike: do CNs run something against MNs every weekend (or otherwise) that might be causing errors
Dave: they shouldn't be; are you having problems?
Mike: last two weeks have had tomcat go down and had to restart it on Monday morning
Dave: no, shouldn't be any difference on the weekends

Greg: we might have something of interest as we get closer to production, working with colleagues at UNM, might have something to share 

        
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
 * 5 MNs in progress for Y5Q1: EDAC, SEAD, UKansas, NPN, and NKN (updates?)
 * UKansas (Dave): waiting for them to install certificates so they can participate in testing environment, will check with Rob to see if there are any issues
 * NKN (Greg): s/w stack installed, certificate issues resolved, next steps are to configure the server/db/files on their installation; need unique identifiers (Ed Flathers is working, we think it's done); potential issue is difference between how NKN authenticates and how D1 authenticates
 * SEAD (Kavitha): going ahead with metadata files we have now and move to production; will get in touch with Chris tomorrow/Monday
 * NPN - met last week, progressing well; had been experiencing problems with authentication http vs https, Ben helped sort out, good discussion of "how it's supposed to work" conceptually

 * PISCO (see above)


OTHER INTERESTING THINGS: 

contact points: 
NEW EMAIL contact: mninfo.dataone@gmail.com     - This email monitored by DataONE staff.  I think we might migrate to this being the primary point of contact for MN questions so we can keep a better handle on issues/resolutions.
