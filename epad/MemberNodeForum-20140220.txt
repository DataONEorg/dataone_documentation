    NPN - Alyssa Rosemartin - 
    Digital Antiquity - Adam Brin - archaeology repository

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
    CN issue - testing the solution, waiting until after the Reverse Site Visit (early next week) to move to production
    Update on Metacat upgrade - Ben is working on rolling out the upgrade this week, includes propagating access policies correction
      
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.
    none identified today

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:
    Ed (NKN)  - 
    LTER information managers colocated at the ESIP meeting, too

FEEDBACK REQUESTED FOR THE 2014 DUG MEETING ---
      We would like feedback from MN Forum members regarding what they would  like to see at the DUG and how they would like to be involved.   Everyone seemed to like the MN Showcase last time.  What else would be  important at the DUG?  DUG committee meets 1st Tues of month, so comments to Amber will be passed on then.

ESIP SUMMER MEETING - JULY 8-11, 2014 IN COPPER MOUNTAIN, COLORADO  
    DUG is Sunday 7/6 and Monday 7/7, co-located with the ESIP meeting, plans for lodging, etc. still in process.  

4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
    LTER (Mark) - metacat right now, affected by a recent issue (CN and other metacat-related issues); metacat upgrade should correct some data synchronization issues; when the metacat stack is stabilized, LTER can migrate to the PASTA GMN
    Dryad (Ryan) - very nearly a production MN (hooray); Ryan to register with production, may be able to flip the switch today or tomorrow
    NPN (Alyssa) - data through 2012, then added through 2013; working just fine
    NKN (Ed) - MN s/w installed and working on a pre-production host (sandbox); next steps: need to make changes in local data cataloging system to support DataONE data needs (including checksums and DOIs at file level) - using UUIDs as identifiers; for checksums, MD5 is supported
    EDAC (Rob) - in stage currently and want to do a bit more testing
    Digital Antiquity (Adam) - has a Java question, Rob can help - looking at the documentation and other MNs' implementations; is there a way to test that we've implemented the client correctly?  Rob says yes, can send link to webtester and other test services
        --- new MNs can all benefit from "Becoming a Member Node":
