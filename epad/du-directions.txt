High-level summary:
 * Sequim is new DataUp implementation from MRC.  They want to keep up their relationship with CDL, DataONE etc. 
 * We were told that they have decided to make Sequim open source once it's complete.
 * John and I got a demo on Friday 6/7/2013. It is much, MUCH improved from the DataUp we know and love. In fact, even Kris Tolle called our version a "prototype". 
 * Kris is working down the bitbucket list of wants/bugs from DataUp and incorporating them into Sequim (bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/dataup/main/wiki/improvements_issues)
 * Much of what I imagined we would do with DataUp using the NSF funds has been done with Sequim.
 * We need to figure out how to proceed given these facts.

Other points of interest:
 * Sequim has an "impersonate" feature to allow deposit without user login (what we had before was one hardcoded user/password pair per repo) and (new) deposit with user login; this might help the USGS thing
 * Sequim als will have an "auto-delete-on-publish" feature, which will remove files from the online tool's storage (reducing Azure storage costs) when a file is deposited

Bill: With respect to any modifications to the scope of work, I will need to request approval for any significant changes (ie budget re-allocations among NSF categories, scope of work, etc.) via fastlane, which the cognizant program officer may either accept or reject (after some undetermined period of review).  This is NSF policy.

John: If we want to put NSF $$ into DataUp we imagined it would be via a project manager that we'd hire, or maybe a developer that would work with support from SDSC's .NET infrastructure (IAS can't really support a .NET developer).

To do:
Formally ask MRC if they want to partner on this. 
- what we proposed
- further development

talk to Ilya - can a dev set at SDSC?

go through our proposal - how to approach these items if we are working with microsoft.

the future of DataUp - how these will impact future spreadsheet ideas.

logistics/budget: if we do a sub sub contract, what are implications? Can we directly pay salary for someone in SD? otherwise resources diluted.
