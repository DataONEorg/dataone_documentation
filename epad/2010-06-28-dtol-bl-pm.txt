USE CASE
...


MILESTONES:
   * (M1) Development/tweaking of the demo workflows and execution in (a) Kepler and (b) Taverna.   -- done but they only work in mockup mode (maybe Lei/Daniel/Saumen to do sth about that)
     * (D1) Executable demo-workflows in  (a) Kepler (2x3) and (b) Taverna (3)
     *  TO-DO: LINK THEM from the "Deliverables & Products" pages!

   * (M2) Export of provenance information of (M1) from Kepler, Taverna
     * (D2) Trace files (in XML? RDF?  LOD?) from (a) Kepler and (b) Taverna  runs.

   * (M3) Shared Conceptual Model designed.
     * (D3) Shared Provenance Store (SPS):  Conceptual Schema

   * (M4) Provenance Store (SPS) implemented and accessible (could reuse an existing e.g. OPM or Linked Data Store)
     * (D4) Provenance Repository:  Relational (or other implementation) Schema

   * (M5) commit-trace-to-PS implemented for (a) Kepler and (b) Taverna.
   * (D5) Mapping description from (a)  Kepler and (b) Taverna MoPs to the PR schema.
   * 
   * (M6) Execute simple provenance queries against the PS; visualize results.
   * (D6) Description/explanation of  the demo-provenance queries (e.g. in QLP? or SPARQL?)

DELIVERABLES:
   * 
   * SPS architecture &  implementation schema

   * SPS implemented
   * Schema Mappings (via Datalog)
   * stitching via OPM artifacts
   * references to data need to be ...
   * "owl:same-as" 
   * Data Identification (common naming scheme)
   * 
   * OPM "profiles" (or just annotations)
Walkthru / Life-cycle
 * 0 (wf design / development)
 * 1 bind data and parameters
 * 2 run wf
 * 3 publish wf results (i.e., output data)
 * 4 (publish wf specification) --- may be optional / but may be inferrable
 * 5 publish input data and params ---  
 * 6 publish trace
 * 7 query trace
 *  
   * 
   * 
   * These should include at least
     *  "find all sources/sinks in the provenance graphs, reachable from given node"
     * selected "deep provenance" queries, i.e., spanning multiple runs, multiple users etc.
     * (see also queries in Ilkay's IPAW paper; especially new Section 3)
   * (D7) Publish paper(s) on findings

eScience Paper ideas:
- include distinction: references &D vs actual data *D
- include in traces a second naming scheme for data identifiers
