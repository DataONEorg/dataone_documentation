This etherpad is for note gathering during Break Out 2 during the 2014 DUG held at Copper Mountain, CO

This session will be on searching for content in DataONE, and will be focussed on three aspects in particular:

1. How search works in DataONE, including programmatic access
2. The ONEMercury search interface, which is the current default web based user interface for searching DataONE
3. Evaluation of a new search interface (shipped with the Metacat repository software) that may provide an alternative to ONEMercury.


Feedback:

Session 1
 * Easier method for minimizing search and result set windows (e.g., click on respective window anywhere).
 * Have either search field and or result set window be mapped to a pop-up that is outside of the map window.
 * Have map tiles toggle on/off.
 * Have main window tabbed, where each tab shows a different theme (e.g., geospatial (done), taxonomic, temporal, etc...).

Session 2
 * Reproducible bug: narrow date range to early (e.g., 1900-1922) time frame; map interface resolves only a few tiles; select tile with value of 5 (over California); map now displays all time ranges - seems like date ranges are not sticky.
