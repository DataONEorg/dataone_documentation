Skye
-------
 * 20140003
   * PTO March 5-11
   * Dashboard UI updates.
 * 20140221
   * Tidy change result testing/verification/noise inspection.
   * Cross browser testing on changes for ubuntu FF 27 font rendering issue
     * Chrome/IE/FF on Windows
     * FF on Ubuntu
     * Chrome/FF/Safari on OS X
 * 20140219
   * Cleaned up some tidy errors, cleaning up change record noise.
   * Worked on FireFox 27 rendering on Ubuntu
     * Font sizes in FF 27 ubuntu are huge, pushing input sizes to be very large
     * Table/Fieldset layout issues due to huge fonts in FF ubuntu.


Robert
------
 * 20140307
   * cn-dev-orc-1 is rebuilt, except for the replication/ldap cert. Ldap will not run until.
   * reviewed stats endpoints for query mechanism
 * 20140305
   * cn-dev-orc-1 is almost rebuilt, need certs to complete.
     * Pro
   * talked with Peter re: log and stats dashboard.
 * 20140228
   * cn-dev-orc-1 buildout was somewhat problematic. may need to review ldap-pam setup instructions.
   * read about hazelcast and outbound ports, may need to open up outbound ports for hazelcast
 * 20140226
   * rebuilding cn-dev-orc-1, writing up instructions on SSH cert only login
   * writing code to review errors of Dryad sync
 * 20140224
   * No luck on the tidy log analysis
   * Looked more at OpenLdap problems
   * Need to login to cn-dev-orc-1
 * 20140221
   * out sick
 * 20140219
   * Looked at Openldap a bit, holding off on rebuild
   * Looked at Metacat, requires higher version of ant thatn 10.04 installs by default. Dave V installed the most recent version of ant.
     * Metacat is not the most recent version on dev.
   * Devised test for possible ssl connection problems, we didn't have any problems that persisted past Monday morning.
   * Looking at cn_log_report code again.


David D
--------
 * 20140307
   * Adding splunk inputs for syslog and apache to cn-dev-orc
   * Planning application update to prod forwarders/indexer next weekend
 * 20140305
   * Rolled out Splunk test input configs to existing dev CNs
   * Found a possible ufw config issue at cn-stage-ucsb-1
     * ufw was not configured to accept connections on 389 from its own IP address - other stage CNs were
     * opened 389 to said port - no change in behavior
   * Meanwhile, ldap sync replication had begun failing across stage altogether
     * Stopped/started slapd on all stage CNs, which restored replication to/from orc and ucsb
   * ADC ldap browser isn't connecting to cn-sandbox-orc-1 for some reason
     * Tried a couple of other ldap browsers and was able to connect to the dev orc's ldap directory - application issue w/ADC?
 * 20140303
   * Rolled out Splunk test environment output configs to sandbox CNs
     * Dev next, depending on where cn-dev-orc-1 is at
     * Still need sudo access to some sandbox MNs
   * Running stage CN tcpdumps through a different packet analyzer to see if it shows anything that Wireshark doesn't, or if I catch anything after another look at them
 * 20140228
   * Cleaned up spammy jsvc logs, forced logrotate to confirm good rotation activity, will keep an eye on it
   * In addition to other tasks, going to look into why Apache Directory Studio won't connect to cn-sandbox-orc-1
 * 20140226
   * Still digging through slapd-related logs
     * created some more .ldifs from slapcat on the stage CNs
       * several dns showing different entries for entryCSN and modifyTimeStamp but are otherwise equal
       * some dns appear to be either missing altogether from one database or another, or they're in different order across the databases
   * Going to circle back to Splunk test setup and doing some cleanup of bad log files
   * Found port 5432 blocked on cn-stage-unm-1 - port used by postgres unblocked on other stage boxes, and orc stage was sending tons of connect requests to unm at that port, so unblocked
 * 20140224
   * Looked into stage ldap connections w/Robert, determined that encryption is in fact configured correctly and working as expected on orc and ucsb
   * Robert still suspects database corruption
     * Looking into more tests for database corruption
 * 20140221
   * traced stage syncrepl back to encryption config issue
     * port 389 on cn-stage-orc-1 is blocked until a fix can be determined
 * 20140219
   * Talked w/Bruce re: stage syncrepl issue - he's not convinced that database corruption is the (only) problem
     * wants  Chris B. and I to figure out which cipher suites the stage boxes are  using to talk to one another and run some more tests on slapd activity
 * 20140217
   * stage CN syncrepl:
     * Ran tcpdumps on cn-stage-orc-1 and cn-stage-ucsb-1, then induced a failed ldap sync replication, looked at results w/Wireshark
       * Wireshark  packet analysis shows multiple connections made, tls handshakes  completed, minimal amount of application traffic, then connections  shutting down with tls error code 21 - "TLS1_ALERT_DECRYPTION_FAILED"
     * running slapcat on stage CNs gives three .ldif files that are highly different from one another
       * Also,  some values in the .ldifs created by slapcat appear to be corrupted,  e.g. "cn=benjam\2BaO0-n leinfelder" instead of "cn=benjamin leinfelder" per Chris J, this particular entry is expected
         * Seeing this on orc too, not just ucsb irrelevant, since this is expected behavior

 * 20140307
   * minor refactoring of libclient objects to improve testability:
     * abstract out object creation into factory methods for MNode and CNode classes.
 * 20140305
   * EDAC testing
     * reviewed status of EDAC node in DEV
     * checked ONEMercury issues in DEV
   * Reviewing libclient architectural issues:
     * depencency on apache HttpClient v 4.1.3
     * reliance on concrete class D1Client to get access to nodes, instead of interface - very difficult to use other implementations, or mock objects.
 * 21040226
   * debugged the accessPolicy presentation in ChangeRecord.
     * fixed the duplicate record problem
   * built the option in TypeCompareUtils to flatten lists of simple types, but needs unit tests.
     * for example: BlockedMN and PreferredMN lists of NodeReferences would be flattened and lead to fewer logging lines.
   * need to reharvest EDAC in DEV then review with Soren / Skye.
 * 20140224
   * registered EDAC to DEV, got it to synchronize.
     * will review and ask Soren to review
   * will run tidy with the ChangeRecord changes
 * 20140221
   * EDAC - registering to new test environment
     * trouble connecting to STAGE2's portal so registered to DEV
   * DigitalAntiquities:  
     * Adam Brin interested in using libclient, but having version conflicts with apache HttpClient
     * interested in a more generalized technical document - about a step up from the API specs, to help with implementation.
 * 20140219
   * libclient_java:
     * looking into apache.HTTPClient version issue on Hudson (seems to regularly complaining about not finding approprite version)
       * not clear why Hudson is failing, so am investigating removal of download.java.net/maven/2/ repository 
   * investigating cost (impact) of using newer versions

   * Trouble shooting for UW's Metacat
   * Work on a plan to fill the action and guid for NCEAS subtree in NCEAS' production ldap.
 * 201402024
   * Developed some code to import the ldap accounts into a sql database
   * Developping the code (Java or Perl) to merge the ldap account treesâ€ 
 * Installed cn-dev-unm-1 and cn-dev-ucsb-1 to confirm the change in the prostinstall script
 * Looking at the access log of the NCEAS' LDAP server to compile a list who are using the LDAP.

Peter
-----

   * Created a document that describes the proposed changes to the log aggregation/query (via Solr) index to support a user oriented dashboard and other similiar clients

   * began metacat upgrade to Solr 4
   * talking w/Robert regarding setting up a D1 CN test environment for development/test of changes to log aggregation to support a user dashboard on MNs
