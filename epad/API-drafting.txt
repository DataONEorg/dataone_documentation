Problem: Automating testing of node registration information, especially the certificate being used for node identification.

Suggested API changes to support auth debugging (draft)

- Update ping().

  - When called with a session, returns the session info. 
  - Add an optional callId parameter, which is an string that is returned in the response
  - Serialization without imposing a new schema?

- new method: pingBack(session, callId)

  - Requests that a node calls the ping() method on the caller. The node should perform a ping() request against the caller using its client certificate for authentication, and include the supplied callId parameter in the request
