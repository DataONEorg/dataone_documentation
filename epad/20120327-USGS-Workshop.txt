Basic Outline:

Block 1
- Get VMs up and accessible (Jeff at USGS)
- Setup accounts (need verified accounts). Which service / identity provider? (Chris)
- Setup certificates for MN operation (Matt)
- Install Metacat (Chris and Matt)
- Register nodes with Sandbox CNs (Chris)
- Verify operations (Run MNWebTester)

Block 2
Use CLI & Bash scripts to: (Matt)
- Add some data + metadata + resource maps
  - What data, metadata? - Test data 
- Verify sync, repl, search
- Access control rules / changing object permissions?

Lunch

Block 3
- R client (Matt)
- Mess around with clients  - Add their own data and try interaction (Dave)

Block 4
- Mercury MN (overview), plus replication to demo MNs (Giri)


 TODO:
 1) Determine VM config and set them up; 5 VMs for participants, one for trainer (6 total)
 2) Check with Mike on internet availability (bandwidth, firewalls, etc)
 3) Which MNs to install: 
   - GMN: Lots of dependencies etc to install and configure
   - Metacat: fairly streamlined, Java
   - Mercury: Untested installation process, but relevant to USGS. Java
 4) Which environment to install to? Use sandbox, as it will be stable and identical to production
 5) Dave: contact Mike about which nodes to install and priority goals for the workshop. Profiles of workshop attendees (technical vs. ...). What formats of data and metadata wil folks be bringing along?
 
 6) Need sandbox equivalent of Mercury installations
 
 7) Logistics - flight times, ground transport, hotel
