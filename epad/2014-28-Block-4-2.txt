Topics for this block:
 * CN upgrades
   * CCI 1.2.8 release
     * UCSB first, then ORC, UNM

Topics for CCI 1.4 - https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/5533
 * ONEMercury UI changes for screencasts
 * Refactor d1_processing/d1_cn_rest to minimize Hazelcast usage
     * log aggregation
       * will continue to use hazelcast for sysmeta map listener
     * synchronization
     * replication
     * cn-rest webapp must communicate node changes/additions to d1_processing components
 * Incorporate JibX extensions into d1_common_java, release it(at CCI SB in July we discussed this as a part of v2 due to scope of changes that would be neededin v1 stack)
     * Refactor CN components to use new d1_common_java changes
     * Schedule Meeting to determine the scope of changes to apply or add. (review empty vs null List/Map variables in JibX, add in Builder Methods for complex objects)
 * Incorporate HTTPClient 4.2 into libclient (affects CN stack - focus on testing affected components)
 * Replication Auditing w/splunk logging

 * STAGE CN SYNCREPL:
   * Sync replication working across all stage CNs
     * Tested Friday - cn-stage-unm-1 not accepting or pushing replications; restarted slapd, replication activity began across all stage CNs
     * Tested over the weekend - replication working across all stage CNs without any further prodding on my end
     * TO DO: Ask coredev - is this good to call fixed, or do we need any further tests?
 * SPLUNK CLUSTER
   * worked on the cluster peers over the weekend, replication activity is now happening across all peer indexers at ORC, and replicated data is searchable by search head
   * TO DO:  Full list of to-dos can be found at https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/5521
     * need to bug Chris, Dave, et al re: whether we want to get further cluster VMs set up offsite (UNM/UCSB) VMs to be set up at UNM for offsite cluster peering
 * REPLACEMENT TRAINING
   * Hopefully should have a name for replacement by Tuesday; if not, Bruce will begin making further inquiries
   * Sending out more documentation to ORNL JICS contact

20140718
 * VM upgrades and migrations are complete on all but mn-orc-1
   * script that modifies node status page is returning errors when I try to run it
 * Splunk cluster work
 * Need to build my keys into subversion done
 * Syncrepl on stage CNs
   * Now that stage CNs are on 12.04, need to check and see if this is still failing

20140716
 * Working on Splunk cluster buildout
 * Still need to bring ORC VMs down for various upgrades
   * nearly all machines need to have their network adapters updated, the virtual hardware they're running on is no longer supported
   * need to bring prod and stage MNs over to new host hardware
   * some VMs need to be placed in the correct virtual network

20140714
 * Brought down cn-orc-1 Friday, migrated to new HW, removed old network adapter/added new network adapter, tested good, brought back up Saturday
 * Gathered up several ORC sysadmin docs and links to send off to the team lead at ORNL who will be in charge of my replacement
   * needed to update several documents to reflect new hardware and VM management tools
 * TO DO:
   * work on Splunk cluster buildout
   * several VMs at ORC are running on outdated VMware versions - need to make a list of affected VMs, test upgrade on a nonessential VM, schedule some downtime and roll out upgrade on remaining VMs
     * this isn't strictly necessary in a mission-critical sense, but probably good to do this while we still have a sysadmin working full-time


Dave V
------

20140718
 * Need to ensure that all VMs have correct entries in resolv.conf
 * MN-UNM-1 is using an NFS mount which is *very* slow. Need to plan how to move away from that storage.
 * Need to complete setup of the maven repo. Requesting that Rob work with Mark Servilla to get this sorted out.
 * Seems likely that InCommon will move away from supporting ProtectNetwork as an identity provider due to a significant increase in membership fees. Need to evaluate whether DataONE will be negatively impacted by this change.

20140716
 * Suggest adding ssh public keys to svn at:
    /documents/Management/Users/${USER}/sshpublickey/
  and moving gpg public keys to:
    /documents/Management/Users/${USER}/gpgpublickey/
  to help simplify server etc setup

20140714
 * Setting up new version of redmine (2.4.2) + backlogs
 * Configuring new document server for Phase II (Alfresco community edition)
 * Scheduling work for Phase II project execution plan

Topics
------

 * Scope of libclient software
   * DECISION: libclient v1.x changes need to be backwards-compatible
   * DECISION: libclient is primarily an external product for use by DataONE users/MN developers, etc.
   * Is libclient and external or internal product?
     * Dave: Everything that we do should be considered external
   * Scope includes low-level and high-level functionality
   * This refactor includes backwards incompatible changes
   * Suggestion: break libclient into two products: one for external clients, one for the CN
     * Against: we should be using th same codebase for the same functions
     * Against: more code to maintain, duplication is possible
     * For: more flexible code for client-side vs server-side software
   * For backwards compatibility:
     * Perhaps move D1Client back to org.dataone.client from org.dataone.client.itk
     * move concrete MNode and CNode back to org.dataone.client, and change the interface locations
     * v2 libclient will exist independently of v1, and will not be backwards-compatible
     * D1RestClient is no longer in v1.4
     * ObjectFormatCache has been moved
     * We probably should incrementally make these changes: first, HTTPClient changes (v1.4), then refactor the API (v2.0)
       * This may sacrifice some testing features in v1.4
   * DECISION: roll back HTTPClient to the 4.1.3 series in d1_common_java trunk
   * DECISION: move the libclient trunk pom to version 2.0-SNAPSHOT
   * DECISION: move d1_common_java Mime/Multipart support into d1_libclient_java in v2
     * remove/delete MultipartRequestHandler which is a deprecated mini HttpClient and causes the dependency in d1_common_java
   * TODO: Rob - change the pom of d1_common_java v1.2 branch such that it doesn't restrict HttpClient version (v1.2.1) (resulting in new tag 1.2.x)
     * done
   * TODO: Rob - change the pom d1_libclient_java from v1.3 branch that points to new d1_common_java version v1.2.x (resulting in new tag 1.3.x) 
     * done
