Issues to address
-----------------
- Need to be able to categorize final versions
- Workflow 
    - no workflow for document management is imposed - do we need one?
        - different groups might want different workflows to reach final products
- Use google docs with a defined workflow, file management/naming conventions, and archival of docs in a project repository

Desiderata
-----------
- batch upload
- batch download, offline sync copies of repo
- image and media preview/browse
- drag and drop sharing to folders
- shouldn't take a lot of time -- don't rearchitect

Supported Workflows

- Google drive for collaborative editing -> final documents pushed to {alfresco, something else}
- Etherpad -> 
- Code repo (svn, git) ->
