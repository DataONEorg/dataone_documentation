Log Records
------------------
- Tracking log records is a challenge - large volume of information and a granluarity mis-match
- Perhaps not so critical for a tier 1 node, but really depends on what is required by users of the node
- Main emphasis is on CRUD operations
- Would require this fully for a Tier 4 node that 
- Perhaps initial implementation might be logging only calls through the DataONE APIs?

SystemMetadata
--------------------------
http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/SystemMetadata.html
-- table lists which fields are mutable by which actors (client, MN, CN)

MNQuery.query()
-------------------------
-- MNQuery is optional
-- Can ignore certificates if you are only querying public data

Design and implementation plans
------------------------------------------------
-- some mismatch between NODC and DataONE information models
-- may need additional tables to collect DataONE specific info, particularly in:
  -- object usage
  -- tracking versioning of objects
-- ESRI is thinking of the simplest approach to meeting requirements of the protocol
    -- Could use additional support from other customers (possibly contact Tim Mancuso at USGS)
    -- This is currently not in the ESRI task list for NODC
-- DataONE API seems complex
    -- Should DataONE support CSW?  Is it sufficient?
    -- Maybe a focused description of implementing just Tier 1 would be useful

New federal requirements
-------------------------------------
-- Each agency will need to provide top-level inventory of their data, with links to additional metadata
    -- TBD on the mechanism
-- Conceivably, this could be leveragable by DataONE

Next steps: NODC and ESRI will talk about directions and plans, and get back to DataONE later (Meeting is scheduled for Thursday, Feb 7)
