A place to record features desired for V2 (or later) of the Member Node Dashboard:   (public facing dashboard only?)

Integration with drupal CMS to provide node content information
    - logo
    - mn document
    - home url
    - upcoming node info (name)
    - short node id
    - node name
    - list to display in
        - show in main list (boolean)
        - show in replica list (boolean)
    -     show in upcoming list (boolean)

Strategy for dealing with display for 'replication only' nodes - both D1 managed and 3rd party institutions (U of I @ Chicago)

Graphs with timeframes (1, 5, 10, 20 years)
Current vs revisions (vs archived?)
Data Set metrics - how many, size, downloads
Graphs to display replica holding metrics.
Graphs of download metrics (potential breakdown by data, data sets, metadat)

Map of spatial distribution of data (sets) in D1
Chart of temporal breakdown of data in D1

Data citation metrics (would need data source for this)
