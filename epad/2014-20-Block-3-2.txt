David D
-------

 * 20140604
 * Building dashboards in Splunk
 * Configuring Splunk apps
   * Working on getting Linux stats into Splunk
   * Stats are in place (except CPU, which has a dependency)
   * Need to work on tweaking polling times for Linux stat - too much incoming data right now, hitting license limit
     * Maybe turn some inputs off or switch Linux stat reporting over to production systems only
 * 20140528
   * Finished cleaning up apache log in Splunk for prod/stage - deleted duplicate entries where found, reharvested where needed
   * Checked syslog and hazelcast logs for archivable logs that Splunk was missing, but logrotate deletes logs there more quickly
   * Was missing hazelcast storage cluster from Splunk logging - added that to Splunk
   * Added a 2TB drive to Splunk to handle archived logs
   * TO DO:
     * get w/Skye re: harvesting CN replication logs - think I found those, need to double-check
     * Bruce wants me to start looking into building a list of IPs from which we're getting lots of unauthorized access attempts for potential adding to deny.hosts across more than one D1 machine via Splunk
 * 20140523
   * Continuing to harvest logs
 * 20140521
   * Old apache other_vhosts_access logs from prod/stage CNs are now in Splunk - data archived back to last week of 3/2013
     * need to clean up potential duplicate events
     * need to pull old syslog/hazelcast logs
   * OIT ran another security probe last night - going through Splunk logs to see if anything appears affected
   * Talking w/Skye re: CN replication getting audit logs into Splunk
 * 20140519
   * UTK OIT "upgraded" email accounts, which means I need to rebuild email accounts on all my devices
     * (Not a DataONE problem, except I suspect my PGP keys won't work anymore, so they'll need to be rebuilt and rolled out - will send email to coredev when that's in place to tell people to get the new one)
   * Old apache logs on prod need to be indexed to Splunk
     * pulled copies out of log rotation to ensure they don't get rotated to deletion, just need to add them
     * Q: non-prod?
   * Old syslog/hazelcast content as well
       * same Q: non-prod?
   * Found some splunk content with bad metadata that needs to be pulled out, fixed, and reindexed
     * some of that was done during AHM, need to finish up
   * Need to build a larger vDisk into Splunk to handle older data
