Attendees: 
Colin Talbert, Jeffrey Morisette (USGS)
Fei Du (U of Wisconsin)
Aritra Dasgupta (NYU-Poly)
Bob Cook, Yaxing Wei (ORNL)


Agenda & Notes:

1. Round-table

2. Introduction to the DataONE EVA summer intern project (Yaxing)

3. Current progress of the intern project

    3.1. Visualization Techniques (Aritra)
    matplotlib for bar/heat chart, TDB for bubble chart

    3.2. IMIF package and example workflows (Fei)
        3.2.1. Show case the modules and help document
        
        3.2.2. Show case example workflows
    
Q. A lot of users are using Windows, make the IMIF package working on OS beyond Linux & Mac

4. VisTrails work at USGS (Colin)
TBs of data to deal with, use subset 
PyGDP package and GeoDataPortal package are available from github
My VisTrails package is available from:
https://github.com/ColinTalbert/GeoDataPortal

The CIDA package is:
https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/pyGDP


R is involved in the workflow execution as an independent application
Interactive Viewer developed by Colin
Multiple-thread execution of workflow
Module suspended state to enable multi-thread and asynchronous execution
SAHM source is available at:
https://github.com/ColinTalbert/sahm
the attempt to integrate ModuleSuspended is on branch:
SAHM_1_1_moduleSuspended

PyQt for dispaying and interface

BaseMap in matplotlib to allow background map overlay:  Colin's wrapping on top of BaseMap. Colin will share this package.
My code is at:
https://github.com/ColinTalbert/VisTrailsBaseMap

cartopy, IRIS package in sci-py stack, similar to BaseMap package
check out: http://pyvideo.org/video/1990/iris-cartopy-python-packages-for-atmospheric-a
it looks like it is built to handle CF metadata.

5. Challenges (Fei, Yaxing)
    5.1. Simultaneous execution of VisTrails modules
    ModuleSuspendedState in Colin's package
        
    5.2. Parallelization and performance
    Colin used some parallel packages in R to handle distributed processing
        
    5.3. CF-metadata preservation
        
    5.4. Integrate 3rd party Python libraries (e.g. GDAL) to interoperate with CDMS2 library coming with UV-CDAT
    Write data back to disk to exchange content ...
    GDAL library is included in VisTrails binary package. You can customize your own VisTrails binary package to include certain 3rd party libraries. You don't have to recompile. 

6. Discussions and future plan
