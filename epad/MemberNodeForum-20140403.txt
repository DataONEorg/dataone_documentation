Attending:  Laura Moyers, Chris Jones, Corinna Gries, Ryan Scherle

Regrets:  Bruce Wilson, Amber Budden

Action items from last time:
    Laura to ensure that there is an "ongoing operations" placeholder in DataONE documentation (example: what to do when a MN needs to be taken down for an upgrade, and how to do it)   --- I know it's there (NO IT'S NOT), but I haven't laid hands on it yet.
        INFORMATION:  
     * http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/ for operations documentation, and specifically http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/member_node_deployment/mn_checklist.html for MN deployment
     * http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/ for architecture documentation
     * Rob Nahf has some operations documentation drafted, but it's not been "published" yet
     * QUESTION:  What have you seen in your MN's operations that you needed to ask how to do, what is the proper procedure, etc.?  An example: what to do when you need to take your MN down for a software upgrade, etc.
         * pause synchronization??  if you want to stop harvesting for a little while, you can set the field for synchronization true/false in your Node document; different s/w stacks do it a little differently (metacat vs GMN, etc.)
         * The easiest way to do this is for you to call CN.updateNodeCapabilities(). It should be pretty simple with curl, doing a PUT to /node something like this:
         * curl -E urn_node_THISNODE.pem -X PUT -F “node=@/someDirectory/memberNode.xml” https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/node/urn:node:THISNODE
         * Just set sychronize=“false” in your memberNode.xml file.
         * How do I set the node as 'down' when 
    
Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions: 
    Corinna Gries from GLEON - in development, up and running in staging, 2 datasets so far; want to encourage folks to submit their data now; trying to figure out how to make Morpho work with their interface (Chris helping to troubleshoot)  -  at meeting previously in Argentina, it was desired to put the MN in production so stakeholders can see if they wish to make it permanently production -- now we think that showing stakeholders what it looks like in staging will be sufficient for them to make a decision.

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
 *     CN issue - process nicknamed the "tidy process" is running now; notification will go out when completed  
   * metadata merge across 3 CNs is complete, now running CN-CN matching/synching
 *     Coordinating nodes upgraded to metacat 2.4.1 successfully
 *     in planning - want to upgrade all DataONE virtual machines to latest Ubuntu (12.0.4 first, then 14.0.4 when it is available (and stable))
      
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.
 *     Mike (PISCO) - two issues: indexing and synchronization 
 *     MN "dashboard" - the almost-ready-for-prime-time dashboard is here:  http://129.24.63.92/current-mem-nodes; final review, comments/questions?  
   
3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:

DIGITAL CURATION SURVEY from Inna Kouper (SEAD)  --  REMINDER
If you are involved in taking care of digital materials of any type, form and purpose and are interested in the advancement of digital curation as a professional field, we invite you to participate in a study that looks at patterns of professional participation in digital curation. 
 
The survey takes about 20 min to complete and can be found at http://bit.ly/1osgTQ7
 
FEEDBACK REQUESTED FOR THE 2014 DUG MEETING ---
        We would like feedback from MN Forum members regarding what they  would   like to see at the DUG and how they would like to be  involved.    Everyone seemed to like the MN Showcase last time.  What  else would be   important at the DUG?  DUG committee meets 1st Tues of  month, so  comments to Amber will be passed on then.
        Have a MN Forum meeting in person (yay)
        MN Showcase ideas - new MNs since the last DUG present, but have info from current MNs available on the website
        
ESIP SUMMER MEETING - JULY 8-11, 2014 IN COPPER MOUNTAIN, COLORADO  
    DUG is Sunday 7/6 and Monday 7/7, co-located with the ESIP meeting, plans for lodging, etc. still in process.  Save the date notice going out next week with survey.

    
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
Dryad (Ryan) - have had some issues on their servers and needed to pause synchronization temporarily; we think we've about got that resolved, except that there are ~6 data packages that aren't going but it keeps trying to harvest them.  Chris will check with Robert, because we think that there should be a "after x unsuccessful tries, stop trying" function.  Ryan to send PIDs for the wonky packages to Chris to troubleshoot.

If you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed here, please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org.
