     * Meeting w/Bruce tomorrow - next steps w/Splunk

Rob N.
------
 * 20131127
   * fixed sync logic bug #4182
   * committed cn readOnly mode code. #4186
 * 20131122
   * EDAC can implement millisecond precision on fromDate in listObjects.
   * discovered that sync update method doesn't allow for null changes to be ignored, also that only one of obsoletedBy and isArchived is recorded due to 'else if' construct.
     * https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4182
     * will make subtask of 3736 for second point.
   * adjusting Tier1.testGet test to try to avoid getting very large objects: testing against EDAC tries to get a 200Mb item and throws a heap error.
   * adding millisecond precision test to Tier 1 MN tests.
 * 20131120
   * troubleshooting EDAC issues in stage
     * EDAC time precision is lower than the standard, which is leaving a pid in the set of objects to sync. It's failing sync, too, so resulting in repeated syncFaileds being sent to the MN.
     * 
 * 20131115
   * committed draft of auth'r and auth'n overview (user-level guide), sending it to non-coredev people for review.

 * 20131113
   * writing up authentication documentation (user-level guide) for architecture docs.
   * EDAC:
     * auditing sync and CN-replication of submitted content.
     * goal: review indexing with EDAC

Robert W
--------
 * 20131127
   * Worked on CN Audit Design
 * 20131125
   * Worked on CN Audit Design
 * 20131122
   * Worked on CN Audit Design
 * 20131120
   * Worked on CN Audit Design
   * Answered some questions, ignored others...
 * 20131118
   * Production issues are becoming a nest of hornets
   * - Robert still investigating split brain issue.
   * - Split brain priority is higher than Metacat perf fixes
   * - Issues are not visisble from the outside.
   * - will probably need to merge CN sysmeta records then do MN resync.
   * - Two issues: Sysmeta is inconsistent and CNs have different sysmeta counts.
   * - LDAP problem also caused sync failures. Due to CNs not having entries for Gulf Watch.
 * 20131115
   * MN-MN replication started for KNB.
 * 20131113
   * Re-Replication of Content. UCSB and ORC are missing similar content that UNM holds. UNM is missing content that ORC holds. UCSB is missing a small set of content that ORC holds.
   * Diff on PIDs counts from three different CNs. Compare PID sets. Fix missing Objects on one cn to the next
   * use netcat to verify open ports between 3 cns
   * GOA, USANPN (obsoletes/ObsoletedBy)
     * SystemMetadata on the different CNs may not be correct.  Work on a way to discover differences and resolve.

Total number of object that have replicas
Total number of replicas that have been made by d1 replication service
Total number of replicas requested by replication policies

Update set of Pids from KNB to allow for a max of two replicas in replication policy
Query CNs for counts of replicas vs replication policies
For those replicas in the CN that does not have a replication policy, then is was an out of band replica (different count #)

CN Upgrade discussion

Rollout Procedure for Metacat 2.3.0
-----------------------------------

0. Turn off d1-processing

1. ensure CN metacats have replicated all content between themselves successfully.
- Use Metacat admin ui first
- Restart TC second
- Use CN repair tool
  - runs on the CN, requires a diff'd list of pids as input, plus cn url it is replicating to
  
2.upgrade ucsb and unm

    - upgrade via apt-get upgrade
    - close off hazelcast ports via ufw to orc.
    - re-setup metacat via administrative interface
    - restart tc
    - confirm that both metacat instances have the same sysmeta
        - if they don't restart tc in different order
    - Before d1-processing is started on unm/ucsb
        - FIX replication.properties metacat.password (password is from dev env)
        - FIX process daemon application context wrt to replication beans
            (configure application context for replication as in 1.1.0 tag)
        
3. change RR to point at UCSB (remove orc)

4. upgrade orc
    - upgrade via apt-get upgrade
    - turn on the ports for orc on ucsb and unm
    - upgrade via apt-get upgrade
    - re-setup metacat via administrative interface
    - restart tc
        -confirm that all metacat instances have the same sysmeta
            -if ucsb/unm do not have sysmeta that is located on orc, then use the cn-repair tool to fix hazelcast
5. turn on d1-processing on UCSB


Once upgraded, we have some reharvest tasks for MNs
GOA

We have to figure out the discrepancy between system metadata *content* across CNs

Strategy for comparing CNs content of system metadata

1) use pgdump to create a snapshot on each CN
2) use pgrestore with configs to recreate all 3 CN tables into a single new db instance
 * systemmetadata, xml_access, smreplicationstatus, smreplicationpolicy
3) For AccessPolicy diff classification:
 * SELECT guid, principal_name, permission, perm_type from xml_access ORDER BY guid, principal_name, permission, perm_type;
 * output to file
 * diff 3 files - evaluate visually using Meld or FileMerge, classify the types of problems, ensure that the CN Audit code being written addresses all classes

Diff criteria - determine differences
1.) systemmetadata table 
    Any differences in following column values:
   * rights holder
   * replication allowed
   * number replicas
   * obsoletes
   * obsoletedBy
   * archived
   * dateSysMetadataModified
RESOLUTION for systemmetadata table
   * Highest serial version
   * Rights Holder on the highest serial version, followed by mod date (if same serial)
   * replication allowed if set to true, merged to true.
   * number replicas - merge to highest value.
   * archived if true anywhere, merge to true
   * obsoleted if set anywhere, merge value
   * obsoletedBy if set anywhere, merge value
   * dateSysMetadataModified - keep latest


2.) smreplicationstatus - want to merge all distinct/unique smreplicationstatus records
   * Distinct smreplicationstatus records are guid, member_node, status.
   * SELECT guid, member_node, status, date_verified FROM smreplicationstatus ORDER BY guid, member_node, status, date_verified
   * output to file
   * visually diff, classify the types of problems, ensure that the CN Audit code being written addresses all classes
   * criteria:
     * merge all rows, remove duplicates of (guid, member_node, status), and choose date_verified that is most recent
   * guid, member_node, status defines the unique replica status record, duplicates will be merged:
     * Preference INVALIDATED, COMPLETED, FAILED
     * if status is the same but date verified differ, keep the newer date verified.
   * Any smreplicationstatus records with 'QUEUED' or 'REQUESTED' can safetly be discarded
     * True of a manual fix while replication is down - not necessarily safe if part of a daemon/audit process.

3.) smreplicationpolicy
   * 91 rows on unm/ucsb.
   * 129070 rows on orc.
   * ORC likely represents the master copy of this table

PG_DUMP command to run in background
 nohup su postgres -c "/usr/bin/pg_dump -Fc metacat" > metacatDB.dump 2> metacatDB.err < /dev/null &

Reporting
Need to know:
- total number of affected records by PID  
- proportion of total that have been resolved with no loss of information (no conflicts)
- mostly for informational purposes - which fields were affected. Perhaps something like the number of records that were affected for each system metadata property that was found to be inconsistent.

Initial Evaluation of CN AccessPolicy Discrepancies
===================================================

CN-UCSB is missing 1386  Access Control Rules present on CN-ORC
CN-ORC  is missing   52  Access Control Rules present on CN-UCSB
                     
CN-UNM  is missing 1386  Access Control Rules present on CN-ORC
CN-ORC  is missing   30  Access Control Rules present on CN-UNM
                     
CN-UCSB is missing   25  Access Control Rules present on CN-UNM
CN-UNM  is missing    3  Access Control Rules present on CN-UCSB

There are 16 identifiers that may need manual ACL reconciliation across the CNs:
