Meeting Notes:

(1) plans for the EVA Working Group over the next six months (10 minutes)
 
DataONE Post-Doc:  Aritra Dasgupta
Intern:  Jorge Poco
 
EVA 
1.     add functionality for model intercomparison
 * based on data from the North American Carbon Program Regional Synthesis and MsMTIP
 * look at interannual variability, spatial differences in carbon sources and sinks
 * a priori clustering of models based on their structure – algorithms used to represent various ecosystem processes.  Do models that have similar structure behave similarly (and behave differently from those that have a different structure)?
2.     add benchmarking functionality to UV-CDAT
 *  gridded observations – treat similar to model output
 * use ILAMB and MsTMIP benchmarking algorithms and scoring embedded in UV-CDAT
 
 
Meetings / Telecons
 * November 27 – this telecom 
 * Early January teleconference – UV-CDAT and planning for the EVA Brooklyn meeting
 * January 22-23, NYU-Poly, Brooklyn
   * Logistics:  Room block at the Brooklyn Marriott is being finalized
 * February 7-8, MsTMIP workshop in Albuquerque
 *  Monthly – bimonthly teleconferences
 *  Perhaps a July 2013 Working Group Meeting
 
(2)  Short Presentation via WebEx:  Jorge Poco, NYU - Poly grad student "Analyzing / visualizing output from Terrestrial Biosphere Models using UV CDAT" (20 minutes)
 
code for UV-CDAT with some features added by Jorge will be available for download in about a month

(3) UV-CDAT discussion (10 minutes)
Usability
 * UV-CDAT can access data from local desktop or from server (FTP/HTTP/OPeNDAP/DataONE)
 * Claudio's group is working on parallelization of VisTrails workflow, which should speed up processing
 
additional analysis / visualization functionality for model output 
    
 * K-means clustering -- can be added
   * part of a JAVA package that is integrated with VisTrails / UV-CDAT
 
 * add basic analysis capabilities through VisTrails workflows
   * base level analysis modules within VisTrails:
     * common analysis capabilities like subsetting, regridding, units conversion, etc
     * Build modules to wrap UDUNITS functions (for units conversion)      
     * better handle CF-convention (preserve/propagte CF metadata through                      CDMS functions)

 * Add benchmark analysis modules which can be readily used in VisTrails workflows to handle CF-compliant data files

 * Model Structural Characteristics
   * easily toggle the inclusion or exclusion of model structure characteristics and how they influence the clustering of the outputs
   * turn on/off selected model characteristic components, changes shall be reflected in visualization interactively
   * may be useful to determine which model features / characteristics are critical 
 *  
 
(4) plans to expand UV-CDAT functionality to include benchmarking (10 minutes) 
 
 
(5) other items?
Acton:  Cook to send out a poll for the next teleconference (early January)
