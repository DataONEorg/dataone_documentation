Agenda for 2012-08-17

1) CI Update (Dave)
Fully operational and almost 120,000 data sets - approximately 150 new users hitting the web site each day; 3/4 from US
8 MNs - Dryad still not online but are in the final testing phase
On the 4th patch release of the infrastructure - have released all 4 patches with no down time

Small issues dealing with timing and configuration but have dealt with those - related to the amount of content.  This process will continue. Release 1.1 (feature) scheduled for the end
of September
CCIT plus developer meeting next week in Santa Barbara - main goals to identify priority for
features for the next 2 years keeping in mind the RSV and other events scheduled in that time frame.
Split between development and maintenance duties




2) CEE Update (Amber)
DUG update:

Feedback from attendees, NSF, Paul Risser (EAB member) was very positive
DUG would like to become more autonomous
Public Release went well; workshops at ESA
Booth at ESA - not as well as visited as last year even though one of the largest ESA meetings (but not dissimilar to other exhibitors)
Talked with NEON about sharing a booth at AGU

Pipeline for new MN? Next round will probably be a few metacat nodes
AKN MN: someone was on vacation but back now so may be online within a couple of weeks
ONEShare will be coming online soon - deadline is September 17 (DataUp release date)

TERN (AU) - Metacat is very interested in coming online. (Frame)
? Dave - Will you guys also talk about the forming a specific MN Group of CI and CE to help bring people online next week?
Planning on talking about the MN Workflow at the CCIT meeting so will also add this

3) Cooperative Agreement Changes (Bill/Rebecca)

NSF would like the CA as clean as possible - working to clarify any errors that were left in
the CA and want it changed before the RSV

Need to verify all the changes that were thought to be approved by prior program officers
made it into the electronic jacket 

Suggested changes:
From Todd Vision:
1. The roles of NBII and the Keystone Center D v and vii  (there's no vi !) need updating.
2. The passage about the DataNetONE Management Advisory Team should  probably be updated to reflect the current composition and structure of  the Leadership Team
3. "The ED reports directly to the UNM Vice President for Research and  is the principal point of contact with NSF" - should this not be the PI?
4. It might be time to consider reducing the frequency of some of the  reporting and review obligations since we are on a smooth operating path  at this point, and could better invest some of the staff effort into  other organizational needs.
From Bob Cook:
A couple of questions:
does the ED description (E.iii.) match what you do?
Where is the description of what the PI does? You may want to use this  opportunity to divvy up and describe what the PI does and what the ED  does.

Minor suggestions:
change project name from DataNetONE to DataONE.  This could be done  gracefully with an explanation at the beginning of the document.

Sect D. covers co-investigators and subawardees
ORC is treated but the subawards actually go to UT and ORNL separately.   Our collaboration on the ORC Coordinating Node is important, but we're  doing much more than that.  The text lists some specific UT activities  and other general activities.  Perhaps you could split this into two (UT  Subaward and the ORNL Subaward), and discuss the collaboration on the  ORC CN in both.

i. we've changed the name to  External Advisory Board


4) All Hands Meeting Agenda (Rebecca)
Reminder:  Cut-off date for hotel reservations is August 24th (1 week from today!)
CEE: 6 
PPSR: 3
U&A: 7 +1 guest
Provenance:3 [BL: registration automagically implies hotel reservation, yes?no - need to do   that separately; OK ... no magic there .. :( ]
Semantics:1
Metadata:3
Sociocultural: 4

  LT: http://bit.ly/NIVIX6
  Add EAB meeting planning to LT Agenda? (yes)
  
  
  AHM: http://bit.ly/OlDxHq
 Cook:  might be of interest to attendees to have S&G and EVA each give lightning talks on Tuesday AM, even though those two WGs won't be meeting at the AHM - yes
 

================================================
5) Working Group Status Reports
    The reporting period is fourth quarter of year 3 (May 2012 - July 2012)  Many groups have submitted this report but this is the opportunity for  the Leadership Team and WG leaders to

The next WG quarterly report will be needed by Monday, October 22, 2012

======================================================================
Working Group: Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis
Co-chairs: Kelling & Cook

Overall Objective: 
The scope of this EVA Working Group is to assist in the development of a benchmarking cyberinfrastructure system for integrating disparate types of observational data and model output in conjunction with ILAMB (http://ilamb.org/). The benchmarking software system – UV-CDAT (http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/) -– will support a number of LAMB goals:  integrate observational data and model output; implement benchmarks for land model performance, with a focus on carbon cycle, ecosystem, surface energy, and hydrological processes; apply the benchmarks to global models used as part of the TRENDY model data intercomparison (http://dgvm.ceh.ac.uk/trendy-gcp) and the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (scheduled for release in 2014); strengthen linkages between experimental, monitoring, remote sensing, and climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and new measurement programs.   DataONE will benefit from an understanding of how scientists are interested in acquiring, processing, visualizing and evaluating complex data, as well as from examples of the cyberinfrastructure used to conduct these EVA activities.
 
 
Milestones for next 12 months: 
 
 * November 2012: Third EVA-ILAMB Working Group Meeting:  Demonstrate functionality for benchmarking and model intercomparision, seek feedback, and plan for next design phase.
 * May 2013 EVA-ILAMB Working Group Meeting: Incorporate additional benchmarking functionality into UV-CDAT, seek user input, and plan for next design phase.
 
Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
 
November 2011 EVA Working Group Meeting 
 * Held first EVA Working Group meeting for ILAMB, established preliminary plan to conduct a pilot activity and designed a general framework for integrating diverse data streams
 April 2012 EVA Working Group Meeting
 * Continued to discuss the Cyberinfrastructure and general framework for  combining data, evaluating benchmarks, and intercomparing output from  multiple models
June 2012:
 * ORNL Summer Intern Jorge Poco, a grad student from NYU funded by other projects, begins work to add benchmarking and model intercomparison capability to Ultra-visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT).  UV-CDAT is a community tool being developed by staff at ORNL, NYU, and other institutions with DOE funding.  A key aspect of this work is examining the uncertainty associated with re-gridding spatial data into a common projection / grid for intercomparison.
August 2012:  
 * Hire DataONE Post-doctoral fellow for the EVA Working Group to assist in adding functionality to Ultra-visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) for Benchmarking and model intercomparison.  Pilot work will be to add benchmarking capabilities for hydrology, vegetation characteristics, and atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Working Group: Integration and Semantics
Co-chairs: Jeff Horsburgh & Deborah McGuinness

Overall Objective:
The mission of the Integration and Semantics Working Group is to guide the specification, adoption, and implementation of semantics technologies, broadly defined, which will enable DataONE to sustainably achieve its objectives for the seamless discovery, integration, and dissemination of Earth observational data.

Milestones for next 12 months: 
 * Work with new postdoc Patrice Seyed, for integration across data sources in support of use cases developed for accessing environmental data.
 * Further refine and publish motivating use cases including a demonstration of the need for and the value of semantic technologies for enhancing data discovery and integration.
 * Examine the DataONE ONEDrive protototype and provide recommendations for how semantics could be used to improve the organizational/folder structure.[?] 
 * Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) group working toward specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data.
 * Face to face meetings of the working group:
   * Next meeting to coincide with the DataONE All Hands Meeting in September 2012
   * Report progress of the working group at the All Hands Meeting.
 
Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
 * Brought new Post Doctoral Fellow – Patrice Seyed – on board.
 * Deborah McGuinness, Mark Schildhauer, Margaret O’Brien, and Patrice Seyed developed initial use case for water data integration considering various dimensions of desired data access.  Briefly, this includes a) a region of interest, b) a timeframe data was collected from the region c) measurements related to a specific aspect and appropriate related properties such as its concentration d) measurement dimension of interest and e) selectable list of species the population of which is of interest. 
 * Identified several example topics to be addressed by semantic integration to be performed within the project, all of which center around identifying metadata that is typically not clear from the data as is. This includes a) differentiating between original versus derived data, (generally) contextualization of data in support of query, and contextualization with respect to specimen identity within the data.  
 * As a part of this work, identified several data sources for integration within the project: 1) Santa Barbara LTER site  2) CUAHSI, and 3) RPI’s SemantAqua water quality portal.
 * Suppawong Tuarob, DataONE Summer intern from Penn State, worked remotely under the collective mentorship of Line Pouchard, Jeff Horsburgh, Natasha Noy, and Giri Palanisamy to identify, implement, and evaluate automated text extraction techniques to enrich the metadata for ONEMercury.  His work examined how discovery of data might be improved through the DataONE ONEMercury data discovery client through the use of semantic technologies.  He examined initial sets of metadata from the ORNL DAAC, KNB, and Dryad.
