Roger
 * 20140217
   * Checked in Python products. See svn logs.
 * 20140212
   * Have finished up GMN testing. I'm adding my notes to the docs and plan on checking in today.
 * 20140210
   * Still testing new replication code.
 * 20140207
   * As part of moving GMN to use database based locking (ticket 2437), rewrote the processing of replication requests and system metadata updates. I am now testing this functionality by running two instances of GMN (as replication source and target).
 * 20140205
   * Done with GMN stress testing. Did not find any issues, but improved the stress testing documentation and added a new test. Moved a GMN specific section of the stress tests over to GMN. I think the stress tests may be completely MN agnostic now.
   * Worked a little bit with Rebecca on GMN documentation issues.
   * The PyXB developer contacted me to get feedback on our experience with PyXB, suggestions for the future, etc. It's my chance to write up some suggestions and thoughts I have, so I started that yesterday. I've written some small test scripts to test if the suggestions are still relevant and have found that some things have been improved. Will be adding tickets to take advantage of these.
   * Will be offline for a while today because I'm cloning the disk on the work computer over to another disk because it has made some clicking sounds lately.
 * 20140203
   * Still working on stress testing of GMN. Taking a small detour into the stress tester to improve diagnostics and documentation.

   * finished MergeJob unit tests, began end-to-end testing
     * troubleshot and reconfigured exception handling between MergeJob and MergeJobExecutionService.
     * too many change records are being saved per pid.  Need to write unit test against some of the real sysmeta in DEV environment.

David D
 * 20140219
   * Talked w/Bruce re: stage syncrepl issue - he's not convinced that database corruption is the (only) problem
     * wants Chris B. and I to figure out which cipher suites the stage boxes are using to talk to one another and run some more tests on slapd activity
 * 20140217
   * stage CN syncrepl:
     * Ran tcpdumps on cn-stage-orc-1 and cn-stage-ucsb-1, then induced a failed ldap sync replication, looked at results w/Wireshark
       * Wireshark packet analysis shows multiple connections made, tls handshakes completed, minimal amount of application traffic, then connections shutting down with tls error code 21 - "TLS1_ALERT_DECRYPTION_FAILED"
     * running slapcat on stage CNs gives three .ldif files that are highly different from one another
       * Also, some values in the .ldifs created by slapcat appear to be corrupted, e.g. "cn=benjam\2BaO0-n leinfelder" instead of "cn=benjamin leinfelder"
         * Seeing this on orc too, not just ucsb
     * Found this in slapd.log on cn-stage-ucsb-1:
       * hdb_db_open: database "dc=org": unclean shutdown detected; attempting recovery.
       * hdb_db_open: database "dc=org": recovery skipped in read-only mode. Run manual recovery if errors are encountered.
 * 20140214
   * Fixed network misconfiguration on cn-stage-orc-1, but this did not fix stage syncrepl issues
     * Next, planning to induce syncrepl and watch activity over the weekend via tcpdump
     * Also going to work w/push vs. pull and changing max concurrent connections
     * Bringing another environment slapd logs into Splunk to get an idea of log traffic from a good configuration
 * 20140212
   * Stage syncrepl:
     * We're up to three different error/warning message types, with correlation of at least two of those showing up in forum chatter as potentially related to misconfigurations on multi-master replication boxes
     * Found a potential configuration issue with /etc/hosts on cn-stage-orc-1: no entry for that box's IP address, just 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1
       * Can't find that configuration pattern on /etc/hosts on any of our other CNs
     * Waiting for confirmation that changing this won't break anything else down the line, then will change and test
     * See https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4246 for more details
   * Found a bug in one of the logrotate config files I implemented for d1 processing logs.  Fix is in place, but need to go through the log directories and clean out redundant/empty log files this bug created.
 * 20140207
   * Working with slapd log data
     * seeing several "transaction lost" events (2000+ over a sample four-hour period), bwilson suspects configuration issue w/max slapd connections, but rwaltz says that might just be a false positive due to slapd log conventions - will research further
 * 20140205
 * Splunk web certs working on both test boxes now
   * TODO: Data inputs into test environment from sandbox CNs
 * Slapd events now running into prod Splunk
   * TODO: Assess slapd logging via Splunk to:
       * see if syncrepl issue can be diagnosed w/current logged data
       * if not, see what else we can get slapd to log to diagnose
