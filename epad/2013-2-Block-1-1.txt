 * 20130111
   * Worked with Ranjeet on the DAAC, however new content has the wrong fmtid for OREs
     * application/octet-stream
     * we don't have a CN.setFormatId() since it's immutable
     * Ranjeet will need to update() all the OREs with new sysmeta
     * edge cases prevent us from allowing changes to system metadata fields

     * http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/coordinating_node_deployment/
     * Waiting on increased VM virtual disks before doing the rollback to 1.0.4
   * Added Metacat MN installation notes
     * http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/member_node_deployment/
     * Fairly specific to DataONE replica target deployments
   * Will be looking at ONEMercury UI tickets
 * 20130111
   * Purged and installed cn-stage-umn-2, now at the 1.1 BRANCH from the stage channel
     * had some issues during sync/create() - turned out to be a httpPort seeting in Metacat
     * needed to force httpPort = 443, not 80

   * Working on CN rollback to LVM snapshot level
 * 20130109
   * Preparations for the 1.1 release, redmine ticket reviews
   * Finished 3 replica target MN installations for production
     * Caveat: performance on mn-unm-1 is poor, need to figure out what's happening. hung SSH conns, etc.

Roger
-----
 * 20130123
   * Refining GMN installation procedure
     * Optimizing config file editing (consolidating edits in the docs)
     * Created finished config files that can be copied into place, with explanations on params
   * Working on including config files into the PyPI package
   * Re: ONEDrive: thinking through search and use of facets
     * Brainstorming session during CCIT? Will write something up for this
   * Will work on production GMN installs
 * 20130118
   * GMN is installed on mn-stage-orc-1
     * apche/python environment working fine
     * gmn account simplified install
     * will install the client side key/cert
   * Optimization of ONEDrive
     * merged query code into less calls
 * 20130116
   * d1_client_cli added into the GMN server (pypi dependency)
     * however, cli doesn't install automatically due to foresite dependency
     * foresite depends on lxml, which needs a build env to install
     * for debian and ubuntu, build env only involves a few apt-get calls
   * Back to installing GMN on the mn-stage-orc-1 VM
 * 20130114
   * Moving to Ubuntu 12.04 would be helpful (has Python 2.7)
     * For now support Python 2.6
   * GMN is working in a VM, installed via PyPI
     * ended up re-doing the D1 PiPI releases (naming conventions, password, etc)
     * recreated the releases with a dataone account, v 1.1, etc.
     * single pip command to install everything
     * updating docs to reflect the new installation
 * 20130111
   * Working on GMN setup (documentation and installation
     * Set up VM to test installs
     * Setup now creates a 'gmn' unix user
     * Allows us to use the default postgres install in ubuntu
   * ONEDrive: sharing the ONEDrive mount point in Windows via Samba
     * Noticing performance issues (Windows is pre-fetching child folders)
     * GUI information is not available (# objects, etc.)
 * 20130109
   * GMN is working on mnStageUNM1 now
     * modifying instructions to simplify
     * Investigting distribution of GMN as an egg for use with easy_install
       * wants to install in site-packages, which isn't standard for web apps.  Look into override.
     * Relates to versioning of PyXB bindings as a dependency. Seems fragile.
 * 20130107
   * GMN on ORC1 installation is on the docket
   * Will work with Chris, Dave on ONEDrive
   * Streamlining GMN install
   * Demo ONEDrive on Friday

Rob
---
 * 20130123

   * Talked with Matt, Bruce
     * will work with Bruce on functionality

   * Looking at JSON response from a Solr search (rjson package)
     * wrap with from.json() - may or may not be useful
     * should implement another method that returns pid list
   * Will flesh out unit tests for these functions
   * Demo of the R client on Wednesday
 * 20130111
   * Finishing up the Solr query for the R client (to handle the solr response)
     * may want to use wt=json and parse the json responses instead of XML
   * Working on packaging and determining if the object is new or already exists
 * 20120109
   * Cleaning libclient and r_client code. Consistency of method names.
   * Added package documentation for the r_client
   * Finished of algorithm to traverse obsoletes chain, added ObsoletesChain in d1_libclient_java
   * Started looking at RStudio. Useful.
   * Bug 3399: regarding reserveId() timing out.  Assigned to Chris
   * TODO: complete d1_r_client, packaged for release 1.1.1. Will use new libclient features.
 * 20130107
   * R client documentation with Karthik
     * What can he work on?? Things are buried in Java, will chat with Matt
     * Looking for pure-R functionality (performance using ff, bigmemory? datatable vs dataframe? parsing modules for other types other than EML described data
   * Ready to be demo'd by the CCIT meeting in early February, released before reverse site visit
   * Step through of the R client next week, should be v 1.1 (able to use query())
   * Need to settle on class names (camel case, dot separated, etc.)
