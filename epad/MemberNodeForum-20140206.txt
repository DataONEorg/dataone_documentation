Action items from last time:

Follow up on Coordinating Node issue - in testing this week

Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions: Liv and Debora PPBio

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
    CN synch issue - see above - in testing this week
    
    Nothing affecting all MNs, but we have observed some off (mischaracterized) behavior where some (older) instances of metacat where there was content that metacat characterized as archived but it really isn't; it looks like the content is not available, even though it is really there.  An example is LTER using the old metacat API for harvesting data; if you use the DataONE API this confusion does not occur (looking like content isn't there).   Part of the confusion was the error message that said "delete" rather than "archive".  This is reasonably straightforward to correct and next release of metacat will reflect these changes.  Metacat 2.4 - simple code change to be included in this release (within the next week) plus the fix to recharacterize the data as NOT archived, etc.
    
    Mark gave big props to the CCIT folks.  :)  CCIT is always responsive, etc. 
    
    How do we know that everyone is using the most current version of metacat?  Contact all the MNs and suggest that they upgrade to the latest release.  
    
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.

 * (From   11/14/13 MNF meeting - Kevin Webb):  Issue with "only results with  data" checkbox in ONEMercury search - currently defaults to checked; see redmine ticket https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4144.
still outstanding. Will require programming changes to make happen. In spin lock until CN issue resolves.

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:

IDCC MN workshop:  Thursday Feb 27th, San Francisco, CA.  In conjunction with  the  International Digital Curation Conference (Tuesday and Wednesday of that  week).  People at prospective MN's interested in getting involved with  DataONE are encouraged to attend:  

 * For details of the DataONE workshop and the other workshops, see http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc14/workshops%20

FEEDBACK REQUESTED FOR THE 2014 DUG MEETING ---

     We would like feedback from MN Forum members regarding what they would like to see at the DUG and how they would like to be involved.  Everyone  seemed to like the MN Showcase last time.  What else would be important at the DUG?  DUG committee meets 1st Tues of month, so comments to Amber will be passed on then.

ESIP SUMMER MEETING - JULY 8-11, 2014 IN COPPER MOUNTAIN, COLORADO  
    DUG is Sunday 7/6 and Monday 7/7, co-located with the ESIP meeting, plans for lodging, etc. still in process.  

DUG Steering Committee met this week (2/4) - feedback was that the MN showcase was well received and we'd like to do that again.  Additionally, some MNs would like to have more detailed information, so we're looking at a breakout session or other ...


4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:

PPBio (Debora and Livia) - updating the MN description document; still working on replicating content to LNCC (in progress)

NKN (Luke) - working with Roger, working in sandbox right now, next steps: we want to be able to synchronize MN content with a CN, NKN has been approved in the sandbox, so we need to check and see if synchronization is occuring.  Right now NKN's sandbox entity is a standalone to make sure it works; hope to connect the actual NKN repository soon as part of the GMN development process.  NKN has ~10TB of data.  We need to get a sample of NKN's data/metadata into the sandbox for synch/testing AND we need to ensure that NKN (in sandbox) can be a replication target.  Using ISO as metadata standard.  Luke will get some sample data/metadata out there by this time next week, then send a note to support@dataone.org so someone (maybe Roger) can help.

LTER (Mark) - 

Dryad (Ryan) - registering Dryad in staging and production (Dryad operates at Tier 1, so can use the same info); Chris can turn them on and check synchronization.  

If   you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed  here,   please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org or   mnforum@dataone.org.
