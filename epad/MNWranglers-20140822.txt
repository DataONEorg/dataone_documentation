Attending:  Laura, Rebecca, Bruce, Robert

Regrets: Amber, Mark, Dave


Agenda: 

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest
        
 * Montana Institute on Ecosystems (IoE) announced Tuesday, 19 August!
        
 * DataONE and XSEDE: latest info from Line:
          1.  The draft letter to become a (level 3) SP has been circulated to relevant people within DataONE 
          2.  The collaboration was discussed at the Leadership team teleconference â€“ level 3 will be a starting point
          3.  The letter is currently being reviewed by the DataONE leadership  team
          Current status: the letter went to LT a couple weeks ago, Rebecca will send on to Bill cy Amber/Dave) There is an appendix -  is this information required as part of the SP agreement?  
          What's the next step after we become an XSEDE SP?  We live as an XSEDE SP for a while, then we look at the possibility of an XSEDE MN?  (nothing beyond us becoming a SP) before the AHM)
          
 
 * MPC and Dublin Core - meeting 8/22/14 at 4pET to discuss DC options
        epad for the meeting: http://epad.dataone.org/2014-08-22-Dublin-Core-Discussion
        
        (Previous discussions)
   *  concern  about creating a MPC-specific DC standard  (is that appropriate, who  maintains it, etc.), much discussion about  how we can best meet MPC's  immediate needs and still allow for future  realignment (with DDI)
                GEO schema: https://schema.org/geo
                Can combine elements from GEO and dublin core into the "recommended" schema
                Keep this development in GitHub - DataONE and MPC can collaborate
                Spatial data is very important; identify required vs optional fields to allow current/future indexing
                MPC's CCIT POC TBD 
   * MPC   Progress - still working on getting DC information to Tracy et al.    BEW: need to resolve the container question and propose specific fields   that should be mapped to the indexing. 
     * Need   for Fall review. No developer access in Sept. They need some   clarification [sorry lost phrase??? -jwc] concerning Dublin core   components. They are starting with GMN implementation.  Plan to have  Roger Dahl as a CCIT POC
     * Dave:  the other side of the DC issue will need discussion with MPC. Probably  involve Skye as well.   Dave to look at an initial Schema (based on  OAI_PMH) for DC.  Bruce to  look at initial mapping of DC elements to  DataONE index.   
     * Tracy  sent an email Tues outlining a proposed schedule to enable MPC to have a  fully functional MN by their October review, continuing review based on  other things in development schedule, etc.

 * Issue discovered during LTER's transition from metacat to PASTA GMN -  metacat  EML for both sysmeta and science metadata is parsed out and stored in a database, but when it is reconstituted from the CN, it does NOT look the same as the original.   Mark, Roger, Chris, Ben (?) looking  into this from two perspectives: 
     * what   to do for the LTER metacat data which we want to incorporate into the   GMN LTER MN to retain "authoritativeness" or ownership of the data, and 
     * what causes this in the first place, as this is potentially a Big Deal.
   * metacat versions prior to 1.9 would shred the EML and store in RDB, 1.9 forward does not do that
   * IF...  this issue is LTER only, a simple way forward would be to harvest  (meta)data from the CNs and dump it in the GMN ... maybe... Roger is  looking at this right now

 * follow-up:  after investigating, Roger briefly responded to me saying "both getting the objects from the MN and from the CN is problematic and the fixes are out of my hands. I'll just wait until someone fixes the issues or determines how they want to deal with things."  He gave some detailed information about what he found to Dave/Mark/Ben/Chris, so hopefully we can address this issue soon.
   * It is an issue, perhaps beyond LTER, but even if it is only LTER it is a Big Deal.  Hold off for Mark.  
   * email to Matt et al. re: putting this on the CCIT work plan 

 * CCI 1.3.0 deployment - done this week
   * there was a question about solr indices (everyone vs an individual MN's solr index) - answer: no, the MN does not have to make any changes locally (Laura to tell Mike Frenock at PISCO and update MNF notes)
   * there was another question about "release notes" - do they exist? documentation exists in tickets, perhaps we need to put out a release wiki, or note changes on releases.dataone.org
   * The Javadocs and other documentation on releases.dataone.org should be regenerated for any major or minor release. (what about patch releases?)
   * Robert can bring these questions up at the CCIT meeting next Tuesday 

        1.5   Current MNs
                 Dryad listObjects issue, see https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/6010 
                     Ryan says they haven't been able to address this issue last 2 weeks
                   
                LTER transitioning from metacat instance to PASTA GMN; 
                     The PASTA GMN is behaving nicely in stage.  There are issues, however,  with the old metacat data we are trying to bring over (see above).
                
        2. Status of upcoming MNs
     
     * Y1Q1
       * ORNL MNs (RGD (4248) and EDORA (4247)) - per email conversations with Chris, Ranjeet, Jim, meeting 8/7/14; Chris/Ranjeet et al. working to resolve last issues related to FGDC, etc.
       * MPC (3708) -  see above, looking at what we can do to help meet their desired schedule (Dave/Bruce comment?)
       * DFC (3532) - Lisa needs assistance with certificates and going to sandbox
         * (Laura to ask Rob about order of testing (when and where) - document this, also what does "good to go" mean?)
       * UIC (3213)    - they're  having a project prioritization meeting next week, will   have  a better  idea of schedule for next 3 months after that; Bob is OOP until next Tuesday (8/19) - will ping him again then.  Ping Bob again.
       * PPBio (3748) - MNDD/logo submitted, Listed on public website as upcoming
       * NKN (3238)  -  Ed said 8/20/14: we've got our cert issues sorted out, and the NKN sandbox member node is up and running under RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.  I've successfully loaded some simple test data into the node, and the next steps will be experimenting with data packaging and replication
       * IARC (4700)  -  Jim will be OOP for a week or so; when he gets back he is ready to go to sandbox

     * Y1Q2
       * GBIF (4730) - development  paused while GBIF does their annual planning; thinking  about working  with Atlas of Living Australia (VERY early  discussions).   Laura to ask Tim R about planning meeting results
         * MoC on hold until after Phase 1 closeout and Phase 2 initiation efforts are done --- Discuss  the MoC request from GBIF.   Mark, Laura, and Rebecca to work on this  MOU/MoC.  Tim R out on  vacation until 8/18.  Rebecca now has access to  draft of letter.
       * Sierra  Nevada Global Change Observatory (4296) - Antonio visited Mark 8/14
         * Here is my basic understanding of their operation:
         * 1. They use a (out-dated?) version? of Metacat to store EML metadata only; no data objects within Metacat
         * 2. They have roughly 500 data packages
         * 3. They do use KNB to store some of their EML; how much, I don't know
         * 4.  They are also a member of the EU LTER and plan on interoperating with  their EU LTER Metacat (this is the site managed by David Blankman)
         * 5.  They export their EML into two other formats: one is INSPIRE, which is  an ISO standard of some sort; the other is a proprietary format used for  governmental use
         * 6.  They would definitely like to become a MN; not sure if they want to use  Metacat as their software stack or investigate other options
         * 7. Not clear at what tier level they would participate
         * 8. Their timeline is undefined, but they would like to target this Fall
       * GLEON (3422) -  Nothing new.  passed the MNDD template on to Corinna - she will pick up when she gets back in August
       * USCarolina (3689) - awaiting response  (ask about metadata, considering DC) 

     * Y1Q3
       * SAEON (3205) - Chris or Mark will be able to help Alex at SAEON.

    Future
       * TERN-Australia - Rebecca and Bruce working on wording of MOU - On hold for MOU until PEP is complete. Might have Allison at AHM.
       * FigShare - Bruce is POC
       * NODC - revisit, target for next 18mos (Bruce/Matt) - Bruce to talk with Ken Casey


        3. Old action items
                MN Documentation - MN Deployment and MN Ongoing Operations - Laura to   do  this  -- working on identifying needs and best methods to address   those  needs, including ask.dataone.org, documentation in mule1 or on    dataone.org, etc.

             
        4. Not-high profile issues
        
              Process for end-of-implemention (when/how to indicate a MN is   "upcoming" on the dashboard, etc.) - Laura and Amber - we had  previously  decided that when a MN goes into stage testing, it is  appropriate to  show them as an upcoming MN.  However, in redmine we  don't currenty have  a status indicating what stage a MN is working in.   We have a "testing"  status, so we had thought we'd use that - when a  MN changes status to  "testing", we can show it as upcoming.  We still  need to explicitly  define the process and who does what when, and try  it out on the next  MN(s) in the queue.
             Amber: maybe list them on web as "upcoming" when we go to staging --  but we need a redmine state to show that staging has started.   Dave to  look and see if can notify Amber and Laura (and Bruce?) when  there are  changes to the stage and production node lists. Need a redmine state to  show that staging has started.
            
            (Was under Current MNs related to SANParks, CDL, etc.)
             LT  to address Memorandum of Understanding (re: operations and service  expectations) between DataONE and MNs  -  is there anything I (LM) can  be doing to move this along, draft something up, pull out the work  previously done, etc.?? (Rebecca, Mark, & Laura have been tasked  with this and will begin work week of 8/11)  -- or maybe not.  Wait a bit until Phase 1-Phase 2 transition over?

       
        5. Around the room
            Rebecca: nothing new
            Bruce: nope
            Robert: nope
            Laura: nope

  


Tickler (things to revisit periodically)

   * DUG  discussion re: increased MN involvement with DataONE - distribution  list to Rebecca 8/1/14  - when is a good time to get this out to the  field?   Action: document still needs to be cleaned, but not clear   which  edits  are to be accepted.  Bruce to work with Laura to get a   finalized  version  of this document ready for Bill to send out.   Target  sending  this out after PEP is completed.    Defer  action on this until end of August and  revisit  this in terms  of available cycles. Put this as an action at LT for AHM if it hasn't  been dealt with before then.  

Purpose of MN Description Document (past and future) 
       Intent is to describe the (potential) MN, identify the    types/quantity/formats of data they hold, - perhaps we need a     "friendlier" format, perhaps an interview process;
       Workflow: should this information (MNDD) be collected at the  beginning   of the process, or is the way we've been doing it lately  (after the   fact) a new way of doing business??  Also consider if  this  information   gathering (form or interview) is the best use of  resources for those   potential MNs who may or may not become a MN if  implemented as a first   step.  Possibly change the workflow? Is a pdf  the best way to view the   information?
    Next steps:  Laura to come up with alternative(s) to current MNDD - content is good, but format/mechanism needs some work.  
    Another thing: Laura and Amber to look at workflow for last stages of implementation, test with EDAC  too late for that, need to pick another one.
    Also -- how does the MN DD relate to: 
                    the node document:  https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/node  - developers have/create this information (node registration, see updateNodeCapabilities)
                    and redmine??    <--- work with redmine as mostly-authoritative source
       Could a spreadsheet be a viable solution?  Maybe.  A database would    work.  In any case, some information is appropriately "private" -   how    would we handle that?
                

Revisit the default "only results with data"    checkbox to unchecked; plan is to move the   checkbox from search  page   to results page but remain checked by default, initial draft in    development environment.
               
Bob's feedback about the dashboard - he suggested a count of MNs on the dashboard (MNs, RNs), probably/maybe an easy thing to do a count of MNs and RNs and display
