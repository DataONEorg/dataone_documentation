Notes from June 15 Data Citation/Data Practice meeting

Folks -- Feel free to add notes and items as they come up in discussion.  Some problems with background noise.

Nic -- see update on openwetware.org.  Abstracting out policies from different journals.  Working on how to abstract out from that.  Not sure how deep to go into the journals.  119 ecology journals in ISI listing.  Found 2 different policies in the first 19.  Will need to look at additional categories.
