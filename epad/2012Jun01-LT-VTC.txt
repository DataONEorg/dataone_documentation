Agenda for 2012-06-01

1) CI Update (Dave)

- Stable packages are currently being built in preparation for  installation on production CNs. A couple of minor issues encountered  that were a bit frustrating but resolved quickly (human error)

- Production CNs are scheduled to be installed tomorrow, Friday in preparation for first rounds of MNs to be deployed next week.

-  Replication issues appear to have been resolved but require more  testing before these changes can be included in the production  environment. I am confident that when we go fully public that the  replication service will be operational

- Many UI changes made to ONEMercury as per requests  from Rebecca and Amber. Refactoring of menu layout pending input from  Chris and Laura

- GMN member node software appears to be passing all tests after a big bug fixing session by Roger over the long weekend.

- CLI includes numerous small updates to improve usability (e.g. meaningful error messages and so forth)

- I'm working my way through documentation with goal of having it available near / soon after the June release time frame.

Overall we are on track with the deployment process,  but still have little to no contingency space until after we get the  KNB, LTER, PISCO, and SANParks data loaded.

Oh - also next CCIT meeting will be August 21-23 at NCEAS (popular vote).


2) MN Partnership Agreement (Amber/Bob/Mike)
http://bit.ly/LOOsFT

Policy details related to DataONE were discussed at the S&G WG meeting. Originally
had a draft Partnership Agreement (see link above). At the time, had discussed having
all Member Nodes sign this.  The draft agreement is out of date so needs to be updated,
and a decision needs to be made about having MNs sign the agreement - if so, then needs
to be signed before public release.

At the S&G WG, the group decided this was really important.  However, time is short so how
to go forward?

Trisha asked if UNM consul needs to review this agreement - Rebecca will check on this
Trisha said UC consul would need to review the agreement before CDL could sign.

John K. would like to see something about preservation in the partnership agreement.

Suzie: At UT, anything with "partnership" in an agreement would need to go through GC
and this would slow it down. 

Carol: Perhaps in the meantime, having something informal and then work through something more formal.


3) Working Group Status Reports
   {these reports are for annual report so the reporting period is 
     August 1, 2011 through July 31, 2012 - it is fine to gather the 
     information from this year's quarterly reports and then add the 
     new information for this quarter}s!

Working Group: Integration and Semantics
Co-chairs: Jeff Horsburgh & Deborah McGuinness

Overall Objective:
The mission of the Integration and Semantics Working Group is to guide the specification, adoption, and implementation of semantics technologies, broadly defined, which will enable DataONE to sustainably achieve its objectives for the seamless discovery, integration, and dissemination of Earth observational data.
 
Milestones for next 12 months: 
 
 * Work with our summer intern, Suppawong Taurob, to examine the DataONE ONEMercury discovery client and the set of metadata to be included from the initial DataONE Member Nodes (e.g., the KNB and Dryad) to research potential ways for improving data discovery in the ONEMercury client through the use of semantic technologies.  Suppwong will visit ORNL on June 7-8th to meet with Line Pouchard the primary mentor and others at ORNL.
 * Create a set of tasks and a mentorship plan for the Post-Doctoral scholar, Patirice Seyed, to correspond with the goals and objectives of the working group.  The initial task will be designed to leverage one or more of the semantic tools and infrastructure at RPI on DataOne data.  
 * Examine the DataONE ONEDrive protototype and provide recommendations for how semantics could be used to improve the organizational/folder structure.
 * Develop one or more interdisciplinary use cases (likely combining the hydrology and ecology domains) demonstrating the need for and how semantic technologies can enhance data discovery and integration.
 * Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) group working toward specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data.
 * Face to face meetings of the working group
   * One for the subset of the working group attending the IPAW meeting in Santa Barbara in June
   * One in the third quarter of 2012 to coincide with the DataONE All Hands Meeting.
   * Report progress of the working group at the All Hands Meeting.
 
Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
 
 * During the summer of 2011, working group member Hilmar Lapp mentored DataONE summer intern Aida Gandara, who worked on a project called LOD4DataONE (Linked Open Data for DataONE – Integrating loosely structured data into the Linked Open Data Cloud).
 * Our Post-Doctoral scholar offer has been accepted.  Patrice Seyed is expected to start on June 1, 2012 to assist with working group activities.
 * Working group members participated in submitting 3 different potential projects to the DataONE summer internship program: 1) Enhancing Semantic Search in ONEMercury; 2) An Information Model for Observational Data within DataONE; and 3) Evaluating the Feasibility of Using Bottom-Up Text Mining Approaches to Complement Thesaurus and Ontology-based Approaches for Supporting Data Discovery.
 * A subset of the working group led by Line Pouchard was successful in hiring a summer intern, Suppawong Taurob, to work on one of the submitted projects – Enhancing Semantic Search in ONEMercury.  This group is holding regular teleconferences to coordinate Suppawong’s work.
 * The Linked Science 2012 Workshop has been accepted to be held in conjunction with the 11th International Semantic Web conference, Boston, November 11-15.  Line Pouchard, DataONE Integration and Semantics WG will be the co-chair of the meeting.  Natasha Noy, DataONE wg-is member, is now a member of the organizing committee.  Mark Schildhauer, DataONE wg-is member, is a member of the Program Committee for the Conference.  In 2012, we initiated the idea of a yearly theme with "Tackling Big Data."
 * Line Pouchard proposed a statement of work "Providing Rich Metadata Annotations to Earth Science Data" to Remote Data Analysis and Visualization (RDAV) a DOE project funded at the University of Tennessee's Center for Remote Data Analysis and Visualization.  As "eyes" of XSEDE, formally Teragrid, RDAV empowers scientists to see and understand massive amounts of data and greatly enhance the nation's capabilities for scientific discovery.  This effort will actualize the collaboration between RDAV and DataONE with Dave Vieglais and John Cobb as DataONE points of contacts.  This research will benefit DataONE in at least three ways: 1) augment metadata for datasets that do not have rich metadata with rich content based on similar reports.  This rich metadata can then be automatically added to existing metadata or be used to pre-populate a metadata editor; 2) the new metadata will improve data discovery as new keywords will be added to the current keyword index enabling retrieval; and 3) the similarity measures used to compare metadata reports can serve as a basis for metadata quality in MN.
 * Working group members have served on program committees and presented related work at a number of technical conferences including a strong representation at the 2011 Environmental Information Management Conference in Santa Barbara (September 2011), the 10th International Semantic Web Conference in Bonn, Germany (October 2011), the 1st International Workshop on Linked Science in Bonn, Germany (October 2011), and the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (December 2011).
