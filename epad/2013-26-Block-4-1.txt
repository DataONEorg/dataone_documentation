CN Release 1.2 notes
--------------------
 * Change to d1_portal API will induce a change in ONEMercury CCI 1.2
 * Changes to using Ansible would go into CCI 1.2.1
 * d1_jibx_extensions CCI 1.3
 * Change to Dryad formatId will induce a change to d1_index config file CCI 1.2.1
   * can be changed in the production config file
 * Dryad Indexing Support: CCI 1.2.1
   * Resource maps for Dryad: CCI 1.2.1
     * Multiple science metadata describe a single data file
     * Dryad XSL is new, needs testing
 * d1_index improvements to attribute fields being indexed  CCI 1.2.1
   * ONEMercury could then search on those attributes CCI 1.2.1
   * attributeText is now attribute
     * not removing dups at the moment for attribute fields
 * d1_index support for esri FGDC....probably not used by MN yet - its ready anytime  CCI 1.3
 * d1_indexing upporting ONEDrive hierarchy browsing CCI 1.2.x
   * Name support isn't quite ready yet CCI 1.2.1
   * Taxanomic is good to go - raw metadata, not referencing a taxon service CCI 1.2.1
   * Region hierarchy is being worked on CCI 1.2.x (1.3?)
     * Due to the complexity of the Dryad schema, d1_indexing may have redundant information
 * Identity verification on the CNs, (d1_identity)  CCI 1.2
   * will limit to CN admins at the moment
   * requires code change in d1_identity to consult CN config files and ServiceMethodRestriction
 * Metacat 2.0.8 bug fix for pid validation CCI 1.2

OUT OF SCOPE
 * Series identifier support??
   * At least include schema changes necessary to include a series identifier
 * Spatial hierarchy
 * Author Name hierarchy

Schedule:
