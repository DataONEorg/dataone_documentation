Why are certain prominent data sources (e.g. Smithsonian, USDA Plants Database, other federal sources) not accessible via DataONE? --> this is an important and obvious question that we need an answer for.   The lack of these resources will frustrate users.

What kind of data can researchers find in DataONE?
-  "Scientific data" - from the ONEMercury tag line
-  "Earth observational data" - from the last sentence of the first paragraph under What is DataONE
- (It might be a good idea to indicate what kind of data researchers will NOT find in DataONE.)

What can I do with data I discover through DataONE?
- Many data products can be downloaded. "DataONE has some Best Practices for working with data" that you should pay attention to. Also please read the help and other descriptive files associated with the data set that will contain any use restrictions as well as citation guidelines.


Can I store my data with DataONE?
-->  Data can not be stored with DataONE in the way you would store data in a cloud data storage service.  However you can deposit your data wiht a Member Node that participatews in DataONE thus making your data discoverable via DataONE.

What resources are required for my library to access or utilize DataONE? Is there a membership fee?

-->You can search for data about earth sciences and the environment from DataONE's home page: http://www.dataone.org/ using the search box, ONEMercury.

We have an institutional repository; should we consider being a DataONE member node? Why or why not?

-->DataONE is a federated data network that improves access to, and preserves data about, life on Earth and the environment that sustains it. If your institutional repository contains such data, you may wish to consider DataONE as part of your preservation strategy. These are future areas for development.  Look at the Member Node pages for additional information and contacts:http://www.dataone.org/member-nodes or contact us: http://www.dataone.org/contact

 We are working with the Office of Research to create a data   management program. Do you have a checklist of considerations or things   we need to accomplish to ensure our program meets federal requirements?
--> While there are common elements to data management plans, different  agencies have varying requirements.  The DMPTool is a good place to  begin:http://www.dataone.org/data-management-planning

3. How do I search for data on the DataOne Website?
You can use the OneMercury search engine available on the DataOne website to find one or more datasets. You can also refine your search options using four filtering categories namely filter by member node, author,  project or keywords.
- actually doesn't ONEMercury search metadata records not datasets?  

How should I prepare my data for addition to a repository?
 * The details of how to submit data to a member node depend on the Member Node and the software that particular repository is running. For Member Nodes running Metacat, the submission process can be as easy as using Morpho to save the data to your repository's Metacat instance. Other repositories, such as the ORNL DAAC, have much more involved data review and curation practices http://www.dataone.org/contribute-data
 * Best practices for data are available for all stages of your project (Plan, Collect, Assure, Describe, Preserve, Discover, Integrate, Analyze) at http://www.dataone.org/best-practices

Am I required to use a particular metadata schema?
 * Metadata standards are not set by DataONE itself, but may be determined by the software that a particular repository is using.  For example, member node Dryad uses the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Abstract Model (DCAM). Member node USGS Core Sciences Clearinghouse Member Node uses the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata with a biological data profile (BDP). Overviews of current member nodes and their metadata standards (including provenances) are available at http://www.dataone.org/current-member-nodes  For more details about member node's provision of metadata to DataONE, reference http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONEMNFACTSheetFormattedDec1.pdf
Am I required to convert my metadata profile to a profile compatible with DataONE? 
 * Different repositories, such as the ORNL DAAC, have various data review and curation practices. http://www.dataone.org/contribute-data Software and tools such as "cross walks" are accessible through the DataONE Software Tools database to assist you in converting your metadata, if your member node uses a metadata profile different from your own: http://www.dataone.org/software-tools/
What taxonomic standard (animals) is being used?
 * DataONE does not mandate a particular taxonomimc standard; however, the member node which you submit your data through may adhere to a particular convention or metadata standard. For best practices on idenfication of any species represented in a data set, visit http://www.dataone.org/best-practices/document-taxonomic-information

1. Member Node/Coordinating Note (actual or prospective) 
    1a. The only person in this category that is likely to refer to the FAQ is a representative of a prospective member node. Existing member node reps and potential coordinating node reps are not likely to refer to the FAQs regarding member nodes.
2. Libraries, Offices of  Research Support, Other Administrative Support Functions
    2a. The crucial question here is whether the institution and D1 have a more formal relationship (e.g., adoption, sponsorship, etc) than simple usage by support staff.

    a. Where is the right place to deposit my data?
    b. How can I get data packaged for informal science education uses?
    c. 
1b.  project participants and other citizen scientists
    a. how do I go to DataONE to see my data and visualize the results?
         ANS -- If the data collected by your Citizen Science project has been uploaded by your group to a ***Member Node*** that is a member of DatONE, then ***see text on ONEMercury and searching -- no login required for many data sets --
    b. how do I use DataONE to find other similar data collected by others?
         ANS -- see text on ONEMercury and searching -- no login required for many data sets --
    c. how do I get other types of data that might be useful in understanding or interpreting the things our group's data show?
       ANS -- see text on ONEMercury and searching -- no login required for many data sets --

Suggestion for workflow:
       User answers a series of questions in a wizard-like decision tree that guides them to a selection of appropriate repositories. Preferably with comparative info to help them decide which one. (THIS is what I hear people asking for. They can't parse long lists of member nodes, and they don't care about member nodes, that just scares and confuses. They really need hand-holding to make these decisions. List of repositories will just scare them off from it entirely, and they don't know what criteria to compare on.)

2. Science Educators
    2a.  Higher Ed Faculty
         a.  Natural Science Faculty 
               i.  How can I use D1 in my teaching and work with my research students?
                  ANS --  Teaching using real data can enhance your students' learning in your courses.  For some course topics, instead of lecturing, you can send students to D1 to find, visualize, analyze, and synthesize data as a means for them to learn specific course content.  For example, to teach climate change, you might send your students to D1 to find evidentiary bases to specific claims such as those made by you, your course textbook, or perhaps a claim made in a current issue of a for-profit media outlet.  Not only will your students benefit from improved technical skills in data manipulation and analysis, but research has shown that teaching activities involving synthesis improve students' higher level critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills.  In addition, D1 tutorials and tools can improve your students' basic skills in data management and preservation for their research projects whether these are course projects or extra-curricular from semester length or summer projects to thesis research.  This would also improve project continuty among semesters of successive cohorts of your research students who are pursuing a research direction in your lab.       
              ii.  How can D1 help me to improve my students' skills in data management in my field and lab classes?
              iii. Can my research students upload their data to D1?
              vi. Do my students have to "log in" to get D1 data?
              v.  How can D1 help me to improve my students' skills in data analysis and visualization?
               vi.  How can D1 help me to find really neat teaching activities that use large data sets to teach the content of my course insead of lecturing?
               vii. How can D1 help me to publish and disseminate any neat teaching activities I develop from D1 data sets?

********************************************************************************************************

This section details User Stories specific to scientists with ad hoc data to share

User story: User is an individual scientist who has data to share. Has heard of DataONE and is interested in participating (sharing or depositing their data).

> User navigates to DataONE.org.

Question is: How can I deposit my data with DataONE?

1st Path:
    - User clicks Data > Contribute
    - This page is really oriented to potential member nodes, not individual data contributors. The section on "Submitting data to a member node" is not at all helpful and contains way too much jargon for a typical user. See some of the further suggestions for possible solutions.
    
2nd Path:
    - User clicks Participate > DataONE Users Group
    - For someone who is seeking to contribute data, this page will seem daunting as it makes it seem that the user must first join DataONE in some capacity (as a "member", according to the sidebar). Further, it is not at all clear why someone would "join" the DUG. How is that different from being part of the WGs, or involved in member nodes, or ...?

B. Institutions
1. Member Node  (prospective)

These questions seem appropriate as FAQs for potential member nodes:

What is a "member node"?
    ANS: Should be at http://www.dataone.org/member-nodes
    We recommend using the text at:
    http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_MN_Partner_Guidelines.pdf

What are the benefits of sharing my data repository with DataONE?
    ANS: Should be at http://www.dataone.org/member-nodes
    Better text available at:
    http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONEMNFACTSheetFormattedDec1.pdf
 
What does it cost?
    ANS: Should be at http://www.dataone.org/become-member-node
    Better text available at:
    http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONEMNFACTSheetFormattedDec1.pdf
 
What is our responsibility as a member node?
    ANS: Should be at http://www.dataone.org/become-member-node
    Some text available at:
    http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONEMNFACTSheetFormattedDec1.pdf
    
What restrictions can we have on our data?
    ANS: Should be at http://www.dataone.org/become-member-node
    Some text available at:
    http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONEMNFACTSheetFormattedDec1.pdf
 
Who do I contact?
    ANS: ??? There should be a dedicated Member Node contact (or at least a dedicated email address). The generic contact form will not make a potential member node feel that they are going to get a response.
 
********************************************************************************************************

This section details User Stories specific to potential Member Nodes

User story: User is a rep for an existing repository. Has heard of DataONE and is interested in participating (sharing or depositing their data and otherwise partnering with DataONE). NOTE: key problem for this person is to understand that they represent a potential member node in the D1 parlance.

> User navigates to DataONE.org.

Question is: How can we deposit our data with DataONE?
 
 1st Path:
    - User clicks Data > Contribute  (link to this page which describes Member Nodes)
    - OK (links to existing page/documentation)
2nd Path:
    - User clicks Participate > DataONE Users Group
    - Very confusing... not clear how this is different. Need to either change category heading or add explanation to the DUG page.
3rd Path: 
    - User clicks Participate > Member Node
    - OK  (links to existing page/documentation)
4th Path:
    - Clicks on rotating graphic on home page (middle graphic which says "Deposit Data" and shows member node) which takes the user to the http://www.dataone.org/depositing-data-into-dataone page.
    - This video is not about depositing data into DataONE; it is about the DataONE data model. It does not help anyone who wants to learn about being a member node and seems aimed at the individual who wants to understand the DataONE process. Even then, it does not really help an individual to understand how to make sense of getting data into DataONE. The video is mistitled.

Further suggestions:

Change categories in "Participate" column to actions:
    e.g.   "Join DataONE User Group"
            "Become a Member Node"
            etc.

What is DataONE and why is it valuable to me.

Why should I share my data?

NSF requires data management plans for  grants.  How can DataONE help me meet this requirement?

one answer: preserve
how might data one help to preserve my data beyond the life of my project?

What is meant by the data life cycle?

How can i learn more about best data management practices, and quality assurance for my data? (Cleaning up data, QAQC, minimize, detect during collection, correct, use controlled vocabulary)

How can I guarantee I'm collecting quality data?

How do I disclose quality for combined datasets?

Down the road - how can I be sure that my data is correct after upload

How would I learn more about metadata?

What are metadata?

What is a member node?

Deposit: how do I upload my data (what add-ons are available, what is the method, submit a CD or DVD)

What if my institution is not a member node in DataONE

What is data description?

The major categories of questions from the Ed modules could be plucked out and become these contributor questions (in a way, they are FAQs).

Why should I describe my data?

Who's going to look at my data

Can i control access for my data

Will I get credit for people using my data (attribution)

How will I get credit

When should I upload my data

What if I want to make changes to my data after I upload it (edits, additions, versions)

What types of data can I upload? (Photos, Videos, Ethnographies, genetic data, digital records)

Can I remove data after it is uploaded? (If I have shared it, can i ever get it back if I have changed my mind?)

Uploading live data (like a stream) wind, water, etc.

Data use and re-use (discovery)

Is dataONE only interested in primary data or synthesis data?  Can I upload "mashups?"


Is there an accomodation for the originator?  Concatenation is not the same thing as synthesis.
