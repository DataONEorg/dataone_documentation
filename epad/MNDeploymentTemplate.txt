Meeting notes

Overall structure needs to reflect the MN deployment checklist phases (Planning, developing, testing, operating)

For example:  
Task:  Planning
    Determine feasibility = Establish contact with potential MN organization
    Join DataONE = Create DataONE identity 

In the tasks: SSL Certificates --> SSL Certificates for Development, rename 'urn:node:KUBI' to 'urn:node:mnTestKUBI' since this is the convention we're following now


http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/member_node_deployment/mn_checklist.html
http://www.dataone.org/member-node-deployment-process
- "How to become a member node" is non-technical overview of the Member Node Deployment Checklist.
- Each doc references the other.

In the tickets, link back to the checklist.

Would it make sense to have each MN deployment be its own project  in Redmine?


- Anonymous accounts may not be a good idea.
