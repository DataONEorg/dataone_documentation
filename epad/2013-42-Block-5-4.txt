Development Notes Block 5.4
===========================

Last Block etherpad: http://epad.dataone.org/2013-39-Block-5-3


What is "Archived"?

Definition in SystemMetadata schema: "A boolean flag, set to true if the object has been classified as archived. An archived object does not show up in search indexes in DataONE, but is still accessible via the CNRead and MNRead services if associated access polices allow. The field is optional, and if absent, then objects are implied to not be archived, which is the same as setting archived to false."

Operationally (de facto) in DataONE - content that is archived is:
- not in the search index  (as per the design)
- not retrievable through get():  (as per MN actions)

also see the final comment in: https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/3667 - 

What is behavior of resolve()?
What is behavior of getSystemMetadata()?
What happens if an object is referenced in a data package, but is archived?
If we add an archive flag to the search index, how do we update the index with legacy content that has already been archived?
Should CN delete() be exposed? Or rather, who is authorized to delete stuff?

Note: that this is really a part of a much larger issue of provenance. Obsoletes, obsoletedBy, archived, delete operations should all be recorded with a reason, who did the operation, when it was done. To properly support this requires a graph storage mechanism with a suitable graph query language, for example, a triple store that supports SPARQL. 
Note: Running a multi-master triple store that is real time consistent across three locations and achieving usable perfomance is an unsolved problem.

Use cases:
1. Get all elements of a data package (even if parts are archived)
 * an observation: once you have the resource map, you have the identifiers for all package members (and even URLs), so problem solved, assuming the resource map is resolvable. So the use case can be conceptualized to: find the resource map(s) for a given identifier (data or metadata).

Dashboard

 * How to get data from aggregation into the dashboard?  
   * Generate a CSV file? Also generate JSON file that will be pulled into the dashboard from a static endpoint.
   * Create a new SOLR index / core / endpoint

Sprint Planning
---------------
Milestones / Significant Events: AHM Meeting, Renewal Proposal Submission

 * MN deployments
   * (Rob) EDAC is planning to rollout another patch release of EDAC with D1 changes around Oct. 7.
   * Ryan requested for new test sync/index of dev.dryad MN - will do early this week. (Skye)

   * KUBI is in testing in stage
   * USANPN is in testing in stage
 * MN Documentation (Rob)
   * met with web-site team to try to 'formalize' layouts (to abstract the content and separate it somewhat from the layouts).
     * it's a somewhat heavy-weight solution in the context of getting something done for the AHM.
   * planning on draft release for external reviewers on 10/17
     * will deploy to the main site
     * using the 'stand-in' graphics, although will probably be replaced in the future. 
   * web-content successfully deployed to http://www.dataone.org/benefits-becoming-member-node
   * mn_checklist and sub-pages:
     *  updates are in-progress on Dev & Testing phases

   * Incorporate feedback from CCIT meeting
 * Log reporting / log agg anonymous stats enabled (in staging) (Robert)
 * Splunk monitoring (David, Chris)
   * Blocked by VM allocation at UNM
 * ITK tool development/Morpho

   * Filter out CN activity
   * First pass: total number of GETs per month per MN  since DataONE production deployment.

 * Maintenance Items
   * cn-unm-1 object counts out of sync. Logging level at debug. Out of parity by 30. Need to examine metacat log files.
   * Plan UCSB CN and other MN downtime for server migration to the North Hall Data Center, plus subnet change
   * Merrit and ONEShare pid archiving: https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/3980

Robert 
 * 20131018
   * releasing 1.2.3
 * 20131016
   * working on staging of 1.2.3
 * 20131014
   * Report of downloads per object format per month has expanded in scope. re-writing.
 * 20131011
   * KNB Not rescheduled in logAggregation. Maybe a bug in logAgg that after a certain # of failures of a Job it is not rescheduled again.
   * Report of downloads per object format per month is being tested on stage, if successful then will roll out to prod.
 * 20131009
   * Checked in Code. Will need to clean it up and test it against staging. No other system provides enough data to test against.
   * SEAD node needs some edits. * in seconds of sync schedule. Causing deserialization of nodelist to fail (in d1client).
 * 20131007
   * total number of GETs per month per membernode for the object format types since DataONE production deployment.
     * The code is biased to download log records from the CN. If the total records for a timeframe (down to a diurnal interval) is not equivalent, then the log records will be pulled from the MN.  The object format for an object is pulled by issuing CN.describe instead of raiding the postgres db.
     * The code will be reused in the logAggregation auditing thread.
   * KNB log aggregation is taking a long time due to numerous timeouts. I retry to get same log records 5 times when timeouts occur before moving on. There may be descrepancies in knb's log agg.
   * Saw Ben made changes re: metacat context on trunk. Completed my changes as well.
