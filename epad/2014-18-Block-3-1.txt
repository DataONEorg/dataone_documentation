Rob
---
 * 20140509
   * Member Node Support: helping EDAC register their node.
   * d1_libclient & d1_common: preparing a couple slides for the AHM containing status, suggested improvements, requests.
   * 
 * 20140507
   * working on creating self-contained release packages for d1_common and d1_libclient (java) to deploy to releases.dataone.org
   * troubleshooting Jenkins-1 reverse-proxy (Jenkins app self-diagnosed bad reverse-proxy)
   * discovered some redmine features we should be using (sprint-sharing, release-sharing) as it relates to independent d1_libclient and d1_common releases.
   * EDAC user name approval - ran into issue with the "group" subject they want to use as the administrative contact.  
 * 20140502
   * d1_common_java release: 
     * found a file resource leak in d1_common_java, want to fix in branch before tagging see (https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/3369)
     * fixing in trunk as well.
   * re: HTTPClient version, found source of the behavior change between 4.1.3 and 4.2.x - how the ConnectionManager closes idle connections and choses which ones are idle.  It is likely a behavior change related to use of a deprecated class, so not sure if we can get it resolved.
   * EDAC blocked by production Portal

 * 20140430
   * worked with Ben on the restricted HTTPClient issue.  Setting up integration tests to test latest 4.2 release (4.2.6), and latest 4.3 release (4.3.3).  Ran into issue with 4.3.3 release related to a known issue with not setting the 'host' header.  Trying to chase down whether we need to code a workaround in libclient (RestClient.doRequest)
     * Ben committed dependency change in libclient and common (4.2.3) in trunk
   * worked with Robert on Jenkins-1 machine and web-server configs.
   * some Member Node support
   * Continued work on d1_integration test modifications.

Topics
------

Rolling out index from cn-unm-1 to orc, ucsb.  Timing with tidy, dns
    Steps:
        1. Go Readonly across CN
        2. Stop tomcat on CN that is out of DNS RR (orc/ucsb)
        3. Copy solr search index data files to solr core
        4. Start tomcat, wait for startup
        5. Bring CN back into DNS RR and remove other CN from DNS RR
        6. repeat steps 2-4 for CN
        7. Restore CN into DNS RR
        8. Turn off Readonly across CN
