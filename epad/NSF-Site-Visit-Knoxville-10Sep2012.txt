3:45 Summary remarks from Bob Chadduck
 
 Tools are valuable when you use them
 Collaborations are really important
 
 Value along the line not "just wait for 5 years & see what we'll have"
 What have you done for me lately point of view
 
 OCI & CISE: understanding that goes with the relationship among the research, the CI, and the data
 How to leverage all 3 and show the best return for the money
 CI still a line item in the budget
 Elements of synergy - helpful to the DataNet program
 
 Showing the products of the collaboration (compelling story in Washington, DC)
 
 Can document that
