Target Funtionality

Demo 1. Search for interesting data (i.e. stuff that will be used in Demo 2).

Need:
- MN content available
- MN synchronize
- The search UI (i.e. mercury)
- Retrieve identifiers from search interface - manually or through Zotero
- MN.listObjects()
- MN.getSystemMetadata()
- CN populate search index


Demo 2. The EVA demo. 
This involves an investigator downloading data from DataONE into R and executing the scripts to generate a distribution map. 
Bonus is to publish that back to a Member Node
- about 20sec to run
- single distribution generated
- need to science metadata describing the output

- R plugin, retrieve content given list of IDs
- R scripts produce some output
- Create science metadata for output
- Store output back to member node (KNB) - part of the next demo

Need:
- R script to get content given a list of identifiers
Execute the experiment
Visualize the output.
- resolve()
- get()
- R environment


Demo 3. Basic process of a researcher adding content to a Member Node with some discovery 

- Add content to DataONE using client. Ideal = Morpho, minimum = CLI
- Verify content available on Member Node
- Verify content available on > 1 Member Node
- Content available in search index
- Add discovered content to Zotero

- emphasize that content is being pulled from multiple sources and metadata formats

Need:
- Morpho able to add content to KNB node using existing mechanisms or prefereably through DataONE interface
- create() operational on MNs
- CLI able to execute create()
- synchronization, resolve, search interface

Demo 4. 
- Turn off a member node and show that the content is still retrievable

Need:
- MN replication
- Notification that replication has completed (log messages)
