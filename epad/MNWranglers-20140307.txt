Attending:  Bruce, Rebecca, Laura

Regrets:  Dave, Amber (maybe)

Agenda: 

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest)
        
        New MNs announcements? -  
       * GOA awaiting news item review from GOA folks
       * Dryad - turned on 2/22/14, when to announce ???  we'll ask Amber to proceed

        IDCC workshop feedback - needed more time for questions/answers
        
        1.5    Current MNs
       * eBird Update: see content from email from Steve 02/18 in last week's epad:
                    http://epad.dataone.org/MNWranglers-20140221
                    after further review, it looks like there is nothing to address; perhaps he was just "documenting" so there would be no question about their dataset (replacing with all + current rather than adding a separate dataset with just current)
                    Laura to check DOIs on the 2012 dataset and 2013 dataset (related to the whole immutability issue)
                    (see how NPN does data too)

        2. Status of upcoming MNs
        
        Future
       * Australia (4286): meeting 3/4/14; Bruce working on draft MOU based on discussion which identified 5 near-term focus areas:
           * Focus area 1: Enable discovery of TERN's metadata holdings through DataONE discovery interfaces. 
           * Focus area 2: Enable the discovery of DataONE data holdings via the TERN Data Discovery Portal
           * Focus area 3: Collaborate on the development and distribution of educational resources relevant to data management, preservation, curation, and usage
           * Focus area 4: Collaborate  on the development and distribution of tools and best practices for  cyberinfrastructure (including cybersecurity), project management,  project operation, governance, sustainability, benchmarking,  international collaborations, education, and community engagment related  to the execution of collaborative projects such as TERN and DataONE.  
           * Focus area 5: Develop and refine analysis  and synthesis capabilities related to transdisciplinary collaboration,  including the reduction to practice of ways that multiple different  forms and sources of data can be combined to achieve transdisciplinary  scientific objectives
         * Guru said that TERN's intent is to be in a position to work on development efforts with DataONE the second half of this year, so we plan to spend the remainder of the first half of the year firming up the MOU and probably some pre-planning efforts so that when July rolls around, we're ready to go.

       * ORNL "slender nodes" (RGD (4248) and EDORA (4247)) -  next meeting 3/19/14, Jim Green working, Chris et al. supporting (debugging wrt certs)

       * USGS ScienceBase (4002) -  Need response from Mike
       * LTER-Europe (3232) -  Per email from Ben 1/23/14, "LTER_EUROPE is registered and just waiting to be "flipped on"."  They have upgraded their metacat.  Awaiting approval from David Blankman re: news item.  
       * EDAC (3221)  -  EDAC to go ASAP after Dryad; draft news item sent to Rebecca for  input from interested parties; will get back to you after RSV so by end  of next week (2/28)  Email from Rob earlier this week - a couple things for Soren to do and then we can get certs and register in production.  
       * U  Illinois Chicago (3213) - Chris and Bob pick up after CN.
       * PPBio  (3748) - difficulty replicating between metacat instances at INPA and LNCC; David Dias and Ben L working; draft news item in progress
       * SAEON (3205)  - they  have migrated their server to their national office; need to upgrade  Metacat; need some assistance from DataONE; Matt has responded  (Looking at next week - week of 10 March - and availability of Chris to upgrade.)
       * NKN (3238) - registering node in test (Laura to check with Ed for status - he's been traveling this week)

     * Y5Q4
       * EU BON (3964) - We are going to start with a MN at the Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatatory; they can begin working with DataONE at the end of April.
       * DFC  (3532) -  Mary Whitton from RENCI was to attend the IDCC workshop
       * MPC  (3708) - Actively working re: metadata formats, etc. Laura ACTION to touch base and see what's going on up there.
