Attending: Laura, John, Dave, Amber, Rebecca, Bruce

Regrets:  Matt


Agenda: 

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest)
        
        Dashboard:  Tentative plan is to push out the simple dashboard mid-January and then add map functionality prior to NSF review end of February.  Delayed because of CN synch, but it's in pretty good shape.  
        
        CN synch issue - Per Dave 1/9/14 (MNF):  Expect resolution next week.  Very complicated issue; we think we've identified/solved the original cause of the synch issue (this impacted maybe 1% of records).

        New MNs announcements? -  holding off until after CN issues resolved
            do we have a desc doc for KUBI? - Dave?  yes, they have a draft version they will send to us.

Status of News Release: NPN - done, GOA - missing, KUBI - ?, Dryad - ?  --  I'll follow up on these (Laura).

        IDCC workshop 2/27/14 -  workshop announced http://www.dataone.org/news/register-now-dataone-mn-implementation-workshop  
             Bruce set up a collaboration area in Dropbox for us to work together on this. 
             https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0o7m3448b05m8h7/uLrxcxM5ZI
             Bruce to check with Rebecca and see to whom we have extended invitations so far. 
            
        Dryad ready to come online after CN synch.  Would be nice for Dryad to advertise coming online via social media (twitter, etc.).
            Ryan is working on installing certificate(s), register in staging to do a complete test of the most accurate/complete Dryad data.  We're confident that the majority of Dryad's data will index properly.  
     
     
        2. Status of MNs
        
        A couple new folks expressing interest:
     * JaLTER (Japan Long Term Ecological Research Network) - Nobu Ohte met Dave at Open Data in Biodiversity and Ecological Research conference in Nov.  They have a steering committee meeting in March where Nobu plans to introduce DataONE to the cmte.  Perhaps after that we can start some conversations about becoming a MN.  They run metacat.  Yay.  They have good quality metadata.
     * Holden Arboretum in Kirtland, OH (near Cleveland) - (for Knoxville folks, this reads like an Ijams Nature Center) - Juliana Medeiros approached Dave at AGU.  They seem to be young in their data management development, but it's a possibility for future MN or making their data available at another MN.  Laura/Bruce to follow up with Juliana.
        
        Future
       * Australia:  Bruce/Laura met with Alison/Siddeswara Guru (ACEAS & TERN data synthesis manager) 1/9/14.   Alison & Guru will be at meeting 15-17 January that Bill will be attending.  Need to make sure he's prepped  for that.  Plan to meet again end of week of 20 January.  Technically, there are some TERN constituents who could become a MN more readily now, but sociopolitically it is desired that they be one TERN MN.
       * CitSci  -- Nicole Kaplan (Colorado State University) planning to attend IDCC workshop.  
       * Multiple ORNL potentials (reference meeting with Giri et al. http://epad.dataone.org/2013-10-10-ORNL-MN ).depending on technical, communications, and social issues to be resolved.
       * Center for Open Science Framework (VA) Andrew Sallans- more info after call next week (week of 6 January)  - Rebecca says we will be moving forward with this.
       * 
     * Y5Q2
       * Gulf of Alaska DP (3531) - The GoA PIs et al. met before Thanksgiving, which is what we were waiting for before we could announce. Need info from Matt.
         * Matt: Just need to write the press release; node is fully synced in production - question: have PIs said "yes"? 
       * FRIM (4083) - Jing Tao D1 contact, Omar Ali is tech MN POC, currently installing latest version of Metacat, Jing sent an email to Omar.  I haven't seen a reply yet.  Laura to ask Jing if he's heard from Omar, etc.
       * LTER-Europe (3232) - 
         * Matt: No movement. I emailed them today (12/20/13).
       * Dryad (3118) - 
         * Per Ryan 1/9/14 at MNF, he is trying to set up certificate, needs key; Dave is helping him.
         *  Should be ready to bring online after synch resolves.
       * EDAC (3221) - just a few more tickets to address; Rob and Soren working these. How many tickets are getting resolved? They may be waiting on synch resolution and may be "really, really, close"  Laura to check with Rob and see how close they are to going live (waiting CN).
       * Kansas (3188) - Holding off for CN synch issue resolution.  We're looking for MN desc doc; not sure if one has been prepared.
       * U  Illinois Chicago (3213) - 1/2/14: Bob says he and Chris will get together and status.
       * PPBio  (3748) - LLNC server migration is complete. May need support now for  further configuration. Laura emailed Debora 12/31/13 - no response as yet.
       * NKN  (3238) - To resume development after the holidays per Luke.  Luke will be at the IDCC workshop.

     * Y5Q3
       * USGS  ScienceBase (4002) - Per Mike Frame, planning a meeting in January to  discuss broader issues of how/where this data will fit into the overall  USGS DataONE involvement.   There have been other discussions where we touched upon whether these  (ScienceBase, NWRC, others) will be independent MNs or if their data  will be rolled into the CSC.  Nothing resolved as yet.
       * DFC (3532) - Bruce has emailed Lisa - update? RK will email Reagan & Lisa to invite to IDCC workshop today (1/3/14)  In Reagan's reply to Rebecca, he seemed willing to check into sending someone.  No one from DFC registered as yet. (1/10/14)
       * Taiwan TERN (3211) - 
         * Matt: I haven't been in contact with them.  (12/20/13) 
       * SAEON (3205) -  moving metacat to more permanent server
         * No change in status, no reply to my last email (12/20/13)

     * Y5Q4
       * EU BON (3964) - Their December meeting has been pushed out to 29-31 January.
       * MPC (3708) - a/o 12/20/13: decided  to go with GMN with Dublin Core for metadata; they think they will  pursue OAI-PMH in the future for other purposes.  All DC terms are  contained in EML, Dave recommends create simple EML documents, so D1  doesn't have to do anything special to use; allows richer metadata if  they choose.  Wendy in conversation with Chris et al. re: DC.

        3. Old action items
        
        4. Not-high profile issues
         
        5. Around the room
            Rebecca - ESIP, talked to guy from Michigan, running metacat, asking lots of questions, may have more in common with other biological field stations, pick up after the RSV
                met with James (OPeNDAP)
                Bob Cook's concerns: there's a lot more data in thread servers than in OPeNDAP; there were discussions about threads
                ORNL is running threads completely (no OPeNDAP)
                talked with Andrew (OSF - Open Science Framework) - will move forward with this
                
            Laura needs to ensure that we have current news releases ready to go ASAP.  NPN needs to be announced first, on its own.  Suggest we still announce individually but wait a day or two between.
            Get Australia TERN info before Tuesday 1/14/14. (Laura)
            
            Amber:  see above
            John: nope
            Dave: nope
            Bruce: nothing else
