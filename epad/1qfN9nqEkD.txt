2 members need to be rplaced
Chuck Humphries - will be stepping down

ideas for replacing membership. 
disucssion of putting it out to entire Internet.   There may be people we don't know about, but a downside of allowing self-nomination is that people may be unhappy about not being chosen.  

Leadership team has final say.  

MM - follow the methods from the past until that doesn't work.
SA - we try to have a diversity standard, in terms of interests, disciplinary expertise.  
KD  Also consider geography.
MM - in the past we've gotten recommendations from other WGs
SA - somewhat a fluke that we are heavily based in TN, but also helps with getting the work done because of the assigned post-doc and physical proximity.
SA - recommends we go through the charter first. while people are thinking about membership ideas.  In the past we put together a whole list of names, and discussed them as a group before discussing with the names suggested.

Sociocultural Working Group Charter (this is a name change from Sociocultural Issues)  SA suggested removing the "Issues"
 
Background  
The Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) is poised to be the foundation of new innovative environmental science through a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data.  Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, DataONE will ensure the preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national science data.  DataONE will transcend domain boundaries and make biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; make environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; provide secure and long-term preservation and access; and engage scientists, land-managers, policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualizations.  Most importantly, DataONE is not an end but a means to serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. (boiler plate across all WGs)
 
Working Groups
Working Groups are central to DataONE in conducting research, specifying cyberinfrastructure, and engaging the community. The Working Group model will allow DataONE to conduct targeted research and education activities with a broad group of scientists and users. Working Groups are also designed to enable research and education activities to evolve over time. Each Working Group will have two co-leaders who organize the activity and propose solutions to particular research, education, and cyberinfrastructure problems. (boiler plate for all WGs)

Purpose, Scope, Mission

This  working group is responsible for informing the efforts of DataONE from a  set of diverse perspectives: sociocultural, international and  interdisciplinary. The working group engages in identifying,promoting,  assessing and developing models, frameworks, definitions and theories. The work of this group also integrates across other working groups in DataONE and provides support to DataONE activities. 

This working group will research the social and cultural context of the scientific data lifecycle to devise strategies that maximize the impact of DataONE.
 
This working group will think and visualize from large-scale, long-term perspectives the sociocultural aspects of data management, data use, data sharing and preservation.

 
The working group succeeds by inspiring innovations in the data practices of scientists and other stakeholders to ensure preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline and multi-national environmental science data.- 

SA - do we want to add in the concept that we are doing really hands on stuff for DataONE like "Terms and Conditions"

MM - add a sentence about our objective to have these models be used by the different WGs and DataONE itself, or adding the practical aspect of our development of these things.CH


Carol Hoover - possibly add somethign about how this WG interacts with others.
 
Duration of Working Group
·         Constitute in Y1Q3 
·         Operating for the duration of the project
 
 
 
 
 
 
Major Objectives
·         Establish a research program to identify social and cultural issues within the stakeholder communities that facilitate or inhibit effective data sharing and long-term preservation;
o   Understand work practices, norms and beliefs of stakeholders throughout the scientific lifecycle as they relate to data;
o   Understand how the organizational, institutional and disciplinary environments of stakeholders impact scientific data sharing and long term preservation;
·         Facilitate alignment among D1--tools, technologies, practices and policies--and practices of users and their environments;
o   Evaluate and recommend strategies for D1 development and implementation that overcome socio-cultural barriers identified;
o   Inform other working groups about the social/cultural context relevant to their work;
·         Facilitate the transformation of  cultures around data across the breadth of stakeholders;
o   Evaluate and recommend strategies that encourage and support cultural change related to the data lifecycle;
o   Identify incentives and  disincentives, enablers and barriers to preparing data for sharing, preservation and reuse; 
o   Increase recognition of the value of good data practices; and
o   Explore and make recommendations regarding the roles for stakeholder and strategic partner communities in training data authors, supporting data curation and acting as a facilitator of digital preservation practices. 

Discussion on above:
  SA - doesn't see them changing except for how we operationalize them over time.
  HP - we may not want to change them, but make sure they are inline with what we are actually doing.
  SA - originally this was partially based on member's interests and expertise,  but that has been changing so worth review.  We treid to make them broad.
  SA  - review of deliverables etc. will help us know how to change these.




Expected Deliverables, Outcomes & Schedule

·         Facilitate selection of a data lifecycle model that will be used across D1. (Y1Q4) (locked in, delivered and shipped)  we can develop one to use for other things, but there has been one now agreed to by D1 wide.  we can add detail to this.  should it be a deliverable?  should probably be developed on as needed case by case basis.  may not be high priority this year, and may developed by others.the existing model is from a data perspective, and reflect the needs of developers, but we recognize this is not a person based model and that might be somewhat different.

immediate action - put the life cycle model somewhere clear, identifiable and findable.  
create a limitations and caveats paragraph to go with this model.

Explain uses and limitations of the DataONE data lifecyce (Y3Q3) 

·         Facilitate selection of a research lifecycle model that will be used across D1. (Y2Q1) 
- this can be more involved and less simplistic than the data life cycle model.This is the "people" based model. CONTINUE

·         Refine stakeholder network/matrix -- add network by function.  (Y2Q1) 
KD - what we're using doesn't define the network by function.  Doesn't illustrate how people would use DataONE.
SA - the network itself has been done, but there are problems finding it.  
MM - shoudl it be on the public site.  
KD - we have included it in a paper.
MM - if nothing else on our public working group site.  Find out how it is being used, and does it need to be refined in any way?
 LB - who is using it in the organization?
  
  ·         Data citation white paper. (Y2Q1) 
  CH - include in paper "this is moving target."  HP - long wait for this to firm up.  LB - could have dated DRAFTS 2011, 2012?  Is there an issue with delivering it as a draft?  HP - just because the field is evolving doesn't mean we shouldn't write on it, especially just for a white paper (SA).  LB  - gets to state of the art write now.  SA - who would want to be involved in this?  I'll follow up.  Who else?  Bob, Heather, KD, CH, LB.  Is Datacite putting out a paper?  I think they are based on Berkely meeting from last summer.  Ours is just a 6 - 8 page white paper.  Th eusual areguments.
  
·         
·         Build "persona" description for stakeholders--day in the life, concerns, how D1 fits in. (Y2Q2) KC - half way done,  Important ones are done, the others may not be worth spending a lot of time on.  SA - used a lot bySustainability and Governance.  KC - limbo status of document.  Not really private, but no one knows about it.  SA - the site Heather set up didn't get traction.  KC - this could be declared as done and make it more public or decide we need to finisn a few more personas.  SA - what about the personas developed via the IBIS project at UT?  these are composites (2) off about 20 interviews.  SA - we can declare as done what we started, then start a new phase.  KC - scientists and data librarians one have clear uses, but these others what are the uses and for?  SA - let's ask SG WG, CO&E they may also find them useful.  KC - find out if there is an audience for additional personas before spending much more time on them.  Data Conservancy ones - sufficiently well developed.  SA - we can build off those.  KC - those may be sufficient.




·         Report on success stories of free and open data exchange for D1 User Group (Y2Q2)
SA  - Leadership team would love for us to pursue this.  MM - Scott and Theresa work on this?  They had a plan.

·         Develop recommendations for data citation practices with stakeholder communities. (Y2Q2) HP - DataONE needs a plan for this.



·         Environmental scan to examine the role of journal policies and professional societies in data sharing.  (Y2Q3)  done , but there has not been a paper.  HP is working on it.  A poster has been done.

·         Paper addressing what theoretical constructs inform intervention strategies that can be useful for changing the behaviors of stakeholders around data. (Y2Q3) KC -has done one piece, SA - lead on anothe rpiece.

·         Exploration of what different groups of scientists and other key stakeholders mean by: data, data set, data reuse. (Y2Q4) - CH - about to do a survey of our researchers who publish data with journals who have those requirements.  we'd be glad to share that info.  KD - one pager, two sided.MM - we need to go out and talk to stakeholders.  MD - remine the IBIS interviews for these language issues.  KC - taxonomy of different kinds of data, and concerns about re-use and sharing.  Fine grain.  SA - we cold get some of this out of the UT Data Profiles.  LB/KD - combine with baseline assessment.  HP - how would this be used?  KC - a way to speed up describing what a particular grop is dong.  MM - education too, targeting types of researchers with different education.  HP - a lot of work and hard to make usable.  KC - interesting project independent of dataone.  MD - can also mine the interviews for the taxonomy KC mentioned.

·         1 pager (2 sided) addressing barriers --> mitigation for researchers. (Y2Q4)
·         Environmental scan to examine institutional policies, e.g. data in institutional archives. (Y2Q4) HP - is it important, same SA.  SA 0 keep it in background.
·         Investigate international policies on data sharing. (Post-Y2) 0 not high priority.
·         Organize DataNet Partners sociocultural symposium. (Post-Y2) - has to wait.

New deliverable ideas
Focus on Tools 
Focus on Member Nodes
SAwhat can we do to connect with CCIT, formalize communications
SA - if we don't keep it on forefront the interchange will die.  


HP - how do we suggest they filter on licensing types?  KC - one issue is that filters only work on metadata, everything dependent on metadata from member nodes.  do mn's have default licensing agreements.  Major issues with date fields and what date is searched on.  HP - we should look at teh metadata, is it what is needed to support our SC issues.  SA - we need to also think about how to connect wiht provenance group.  MM - UA had real input into ONEMercury SA - Bob Cook and Giri came to us so we did it.  we did usability.  MM - we shoudl team up with UA on this.

HP - file our ideas to dos under our objectives as a working document.

SA - help issues for MNs.  How do we come up with prioritizing MNs?  

Potential Risks/Mitigation Strategies
·         Lack of participation by Working Group members due to loss of interest; mitigated by periodic reviews of membership of working group and rotation off and recruitment of new members
·         Lack of participation by Working Group members due to lack of time (in general or at key points); mitigated by careful planning of work, agreed contribution and communication of availability
·         Lost focus or not focusing on specific problems that address DataONE concerns; mitigated by keeping in touch with other working groups to determine needs and wants
·         Not delivering useful information at the right time; mitigated by incorporating needs and wants in planning of work and reports
·         Taken away from our primary mission by demands of project and other Working Groups; mitigated by focus on primary mission in planning
·         Misunderstanding our stakeholders and their environments; mitigated by use of appropriate data collection and analysis approaches and checking results with stakeholders
