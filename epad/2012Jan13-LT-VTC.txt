3.  Around the Room


1. CI Status

All three locations for CNs and hardware (UNM, UCSB, Oak Ridge Campus) are up and operating. The Member Nodes are in good shape (Metacat, generic, Mercury) Dryad implementation lagging a bit behind due to resource limitations. On target for a release at the end of the month.
CN software: complicated software and need for synchronization and that updates are propogated throughout the entire system. CNs are sychronizing content; replication manager is working (significant library bugs have been fixed). Another potential issue: resource consumption after running for a long period of time. 
CN software stack not complete but in good shape. Install on sandboxes next week then will be harvesting content from MNs.
Haven't had time to work on the client side of things but will return to that once CN issues are resolved.  Documentation pretty much up to date.
Coming out party? Nothing firm yet, but still targeting the end of the month for the soft release

Semantics and Interoperability Working Group
Co-Leads:  Deborah McGuinness and Jeff Horsburgh
-          Carl Lagoze is officially part of the semantics and interoperability working group.  He (and a colleague) also visited Deborah at RPI just before Christmas to discuss potential collaborations
-          Had a great AGU series of opportunistic meetings in December.  In particular talks between Oak Ridge, RPI, NCEAS, Utah state, Stanford, on Water use cases  (leveraging SONet, Utah, Semantic Water Quality Portal (at RPI), NCEAS stream health, Neon Stream health, ….)
-          Post doc task initial task.  Coordinate with Oak Ridge on the DataOne data sets accessible by the Mercury search and put a semantic search front end on it using the RPI S2S semantic technology.  The goal is to both bring the postdoc up to speed on some semantic tools and simultaneously come up to speed on search needs for DataOne on relevant data.
-          Hope to begin interviewing post doc candidates this month and hope to have them on board in the spring and hopefully at the next working group F2F which will be at Stanford in the spring (although see below).
Selected upcoming meetings
Data2012 – Indianapolis Jan 25-27
IPAW Santa Barbara – June 19-21, 2012 – question whether to have our f2f collocated with this instead of at Stanford in the spring – note that the provenance working group is having their f2f co-located with IPAW.

============================================
Distributed Storage Working Group
Co-leads: John Cobb, Peter Honeyman


Overall Objective: (1-2 sentences)
The Working Group charter will define tasks focused on enabling new and novel distributed storage idioms that can be incorporated into DataONE or interoperate with DataONE. The proposition is that the emergence of wide area distributed storage options (with varying levels of coherence) is or may become viable during the initial 5 year project span of DataONE. This WG will assess the field in this area and look at ways to integrate them with DataONE. Two facets are of most interest. The first is ubiquity in the sense of whether a large scale installed base for a distributed storage solution will emerge and if so, what will be its characteristics. The second is are there any  opportunities for large scale (multi-petabytes in size, and high bandwidth) wide area distributed data storage that might be suitable for a subset of DataONE services/storage/member nodes.

Milestones for next 12 months: (3-5 bullets)
 
April  2012 - Draft charter and possible list of WG members [Cobb/Honeyman]
July 2012 - WG kickoff meeting [WG]
August 2012 - Draft Survey document and suggested strategy [WG-all]
Ongoing - available for assistance and input to CCIT efforts
Unscheduled - Testbed pilot for technical feasibility and performance

Accomplishments from past 6 months: (3-5 bullets)
 
o   Initial discussion with XSEDE (formerly TeraGrid) on
    - Deployment of MN services on XSEDE services providers as an DataONE "Computational Node"
    - Collaboration on storage and data strategy with XSEDE. Explore possibilities for convergent architectural evolution
    - Science collaboration area use case exploration
o   Monitoring of vendor and SW developments
    - NFS v.4 deployment
    - Linux kernel inclusion of storage components (pNFS client)
    - Gauging vendor interest in supporting wide area (Panassas, Whamcloud, and to a lesser extent IBM/GPFS)

 
Products
 
o   Survey of Current state of the art for distributed storage technologies including: cost, feasibility, maturity, and suitability for DataONE
o   Draft strategy for DataONE distributed storage with a staged view (immediately available as well as staged opportunities through time.

7) Looking to explore joint education / outreach efforts with ESIP

Bob Cook:
1.  ESIP Federation is conducting a Data Management 101 Workshop at the American Meteorological Society meeting (on January 22, 2012).  Ruth Duerr and I are the instructors, with support from NOAA, DataConservancy, ORNL DAAC, and DataONE.
Web site:  http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Data_Management_Short_Course
2.  A couple of the USGS Climate Science Centers have contacted us about collaborations between DataONE (and EVA) and those centers.  The two centers are Berrien Moore's center in Oklahoma and Dennis Ojima and Jeff Morisette's Center in Colorado. Of related interest are  some discussions with Nancy Grimm on the US National Climate Assessment.  Nancy is on 50% assignment from NSF to provide support to the NCA.

Carol Tenopir:
I'm putting the final touches on a grant proposal to IMLS to measure the costs and benefits to academic libraries to providing various data management services. Thanks to Bill, Bob, Bruce, and Trisha for agreeing to be on the advisory board (along with Jose-Marie Griffiths of the NSB and Lynn Baird, Dean of Libraries at U of Idaho (and Sociocultural WG), and Steve Smith, Dean of Libraries at UT. Also on the project are Paula Kaufman (Dean of Libraries at UIUC), Bob Sandusky of DataONE and UIChicago, Maribeth Manoff and Ellie Read of SC and UA WG respectively, and others. 

Trisha: 
The URLs for the NBII content is: 
 
http://eot.us.archive.org/eot08/20080916004201/http://nbii.gov/portal/server.pt  (NBII content specifically) 

http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/index.html (the homepage for the entire archive)  

Note that we have more recent NBII archives that we will also make available soon... this will give users options to look at different versions of NBII.

Also -- we just put up a youtube video on the DMPTool: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4942gF3Jnug

John Kunze:
ORNL DAAC and CDIAC DOIs just re-registered from CrossRef to DataCite via EZID.  This was effectively a transfer of the 10.3334 DOI prefix from CrossRef to DataCite.  Not entirely smooth as far as the DataCite/CrossRef procedures go, but it's early days and we expect this kind of prefix transfer to become a more common event.

Bill Michener:
We have about $50 K left in Participant Support Costs form the INTEROP project.  This could be used for another education WG meeting to produce best practices or learning modules, another Data Governance meeting follow-up, etc.  Let me know if you have ideas.  The deadline for spending the $ is June 30th.

Bruce Wilson:
I was out in Arizona for vacation over the weekend and took some time to meet up with folks at the USA-NPN coordinating office in Tucson on Monday.  The gist of that discussion is that they're working on making the files that would be needed for creating data set files out of the database, so that there are static representations of the data for a given year.  The plan at this point is that it makes the most sense to work from Metacat as the member node software implementation.  They'll probably be a Level (Tier) 1 node initially, but there would be some interest in their being able to allow selected uploading of phenology-related datasets into their member node, so possibly moving to a Level (Tier) 4 node over time.  An idea on the table is to try to get the USA-NPN MN on-line in the late summer timeframe.


From Chat:
Trisha: BTW -- we have collected as much of the NBII data / website using our Web Archving Service before it dissappears. We will make that publicly available.
Viv: Thanks, Trisha! A number of places of done similar activities, so it all helps to get it captured
Trisha: Yes, we worked with Internet Archive, LC, and UNT on this front and will be availbe soon. I think that we have 4 different verions that we will provide access to.
Carol: Trisha--can we share your archive locations for NBII now or do we need to wait?
