   * Dashboard UI refinements, review today
     * https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/3875
   * SOLID Retro Friday
 * 20140407
   * Dashboard UI refinements
     * Working on section below node list for display of:
       * upcoming nodes
       * replication nodes
       * will review with amber
   * Will start working on 1.2.6 release issues for indexing,mercury
 * 20140409
   * Dashboard UI refinements
     * Reviewed with Amber, Rebecca
     * Planning review in MN Wrangler meeting Friday
   * Looking at index refresh performance
     * Loading items into map, pid-by-pid seems to take just under 1 sec to create index jobs
     * When items are in the map, can create 10-20 jobs per sec.
 * 20140411
   * SOLID RETRO TODAY AT 4ET
     * resources and links: http://epad.dataone.org/DevRetroTopics
   * Observed UCSB crash out of disk space
     * UCSB down immediately caused throughput on hz system metadata to double
   * Began work on a index job blaster with parrallelized job generation
     * Concerned that reads trigger n-1 system metadata writes across system where n is number of CN.
     * Many reads beget many more writes...

   * We had a productive meeting on the deployment tickets.
   * Laura is doing major changes that we decided on at the meeting.
   * We determined that the Member Node Deployment Checklist and the Deployment Tickets are two sides of the same coin. As a result of that, we're bringing notes from the existing tickets into the Checklist and then refactoring all the Deployment Tickets to have the same structure and contents as the Checklist.
   * Ongoing work on ONEDrive.
 * 20140402
   * Ongoing work on ONEDrive.
   * Must go back and look at dependencies in the Python stack. Fabio Trabucchi found another mismatch.
 * 20140331
   * Returning to ONEDrive dev.

 * 20140411
   * out sick for a couple of days
   * 
 * 20140407
   * Operating System Upgrades: jenkins: copied over all jobs from Hudson.  Imported "trunk" jobs.  A couple problems:
     * d1_auditing_java failing, trying to compile with java v1.3? 
     * may be a problem with the maven installation on jenkins-1.  It seems to be using an older maven-compiler-plugin 2.1.2
   * CCI 1.2.6 Release
     * DateTimeMarshaller timezone changes on hold in testing.
     * reviewed the independent review of d1_common_java, assigned some tasks, fixed a couple bugs.
 * 20140404
   * set up apache-archiva on jenkins-1.  It's a local maven repository with UI.
     * maven.dataone.org
   * d1_common_java tagging - blocked by testing of DataTimeMarshaller time-zone changes.
 * 20140402
   * Jenkins: 
     * troubleshooting / fixing maven-antrun issues
     * have successful d1_common_java, and d1_libclient_java jobs
     * still need to set up IRC notification, maven repo (?), email notification on jenkins-1
   * d1_common_java - review of independent review, assigned a couple tickets
   * CCI 1.2.6: somewhat blocked by date-time marshalling testing
 * 20140331
   * Finished working on some Tidy "dump" tests
   * EDAC 

David
-----
 * 20140411
   * RAID controller and NVSRAM update complete on ORC SAN2
     * Migrations of non-prod and non-critical datastores in progress
   * Splunk released a patched version to take care of Heartbleed vulnerability last night
     * updated Splunk instances across all machines
     * need to build new certs for Splunk and deploy
 * 20140409
   * ORC SAN issues
     * After tweaking vDisk load on SAN2, SAN began reporting optimal conditions again
       * "Well, I guess it's working now" isn't good enough, so going to do some more work on it, starting with updating RAID controller firmware
       * Live update w/o shutting down servers connected to SAN2 vDisks risky, so migrating SAN2 load to SAN1 beforehand
   * Splunk hazelcast logging/alerts
     * built a crude alert to ping on explicit close messages, will talk to Bruce about how to make it more robust later today
       * probably won't happen until after tidy/consistency fixes
 * 20140407
   * Splunk config cleanup finished
     * need to build out datastore for archived data and configure that
     * need to build out deployment server to steamline updates and config changes in the future
   * SAN error at ORC persisting
     * might need a firmware update, might be a symptom of upcoming RAID controller failure - OIT says contact Dell, gathering support data and contact info now
     * want to make a backup of cn-orc-1 to the other SAN as soon as it's feasible
   * Building a dummy CN VM at ORC to test ansible on 12.04

 * 20140402
   * Remaining Splunk forwarders in place
     * Need to clean up some obsolete configs
   * SAN error at ORC - had to reset some settings on our datastore manager
 * 20140331
   * Splunk forwarders built into MNs
     * still have a couple that I need sudo access for - will discuss in standup
   * Wrote up documentation for how Splunk now handles incoming data and how to build a new forwarder into Splunk
   * Splunk indexer was complaining about low disk space last night, needed a fix
     * Cloned VM to larger datastore, expanded the vDisk, then expanded the suffering LVM partition in Linux
   * Talked to Bruce re: OS updates non non-prod boxes @ORC - he wants security  patches in place soon after they go live; for non-security patches, get  w/whoever manages that at UNM/UCSB and mimic what they're doing
   * TO DO:
     * Get sudo access for remaining forwarder builds, build out remaining forwarders
     * Clean up obsolete Splunk configs
     * Clean up Splunk docs
     * Get to work building Hazelcast alerts

---------------------
Exploring a new Java implementation of a tier 4 Member Node that sits on Hadoop and HBase
 * 20140411
   * Early stages of exploration only so far
   * Current progress:
     * Skeleton project set up
       * Maven, Dropwizard, Hadoop CDH4
     * Core D1 java libraries reviewed
     * Decision made not to use the core Java Interface
       * Does not fit too nicely with Jersey JSR-311 annotations
       * Keeps code much cleaner
     * Decision made to use custom HBase persistence layer.
       *  Gora was used first, but dicsounted because it does not have Hive support
       * Datanuclues is an option that could be explored, but requirements look very basic, so probably not needed
     * SSL and Certificate based Auth "working" (e.g. Principle can be read from the certificate) - now trying to understand the actual D1 authentication
     * Multipart Form data wired up - can do /object POST and /object/{pid}  through API using CURL, where data is stored on the Hadoop DFS 
   * Next steps:
     * Design HBase tables for the metadata
     * Design Hadoop DFS for the file system storage
     * Decision to be made: Should all files go to HDFS or small ones to HBase, larger to HDFS? 
     * Tidy code, get ready for a DataONE code review.  Excite people by showing eBird SQL in sub 120seconds for generic queries, get a buddy to commit to it (Kyle at GBIF? + others?).
