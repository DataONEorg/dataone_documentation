Roundtable 5: Outreach / Education   10:50a-12:00p

Participants: Bob Sandusky, Sherry Lake, Ward Fleri, Thu-Mai Christian, Benjamin Branch, Barrie Hayes, Michele Hayslett, Dan Phipps, Inna Kouper, Vida Djaghouri, Dean Walton, Danianne Mizzy, Todd Vision

Talking points / Guiding Questions
 * What needs for outreach/education exist in the community (beyond DataONE)?
 * What solutions currently exist?
 * What contribution can / should DataONE provide in this landscape?  How can that be best achieved?

Needs:

 * Develop curricula for longer term courses; 1/2 credit, 1 credit, or 3 credit Data Management, Data life cycle
   * data consultancy training or mentorship to help IS students learn how to lead these classes
 * Data ownership issues (people from students to PIs need help)
   * distinguish between different groups of stakeholders
 * Take IS students out of the IS department and into the field where they may learn from researchers and researchers may learn from them.
   * internships
 * National Assessment of Educational Progress for K-12 - Technology and Engineering Literacy Assessment (TEL)
 * Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
 * at MS/HS level, teach data management/digital curation
   * call it STEM, it will be fundable
 * students collect data, but really don't know what to do with it
 * Draft a position paper; use of core curriculum doesn't leave a lot of time for data management education
 * Integrate data management into aspects of the curriculum
   * might be easier to implement than adding additional training/education for DM
 * Data Life Cycle intersection with Scholarly Communication and repository awareness
 * At graduate level, consider analysis and visualization training (i.e. how to communicate data analysis, etc.)
 * Library needs to decide how to manage information literacy (technology, data, etc.) - transliteracy
 * Supporting software training
   * People who may know about DM may need to know how to better use tools available to them (Adobe Illustrator, etc.)
   * communicating
 * Awareness: people don't know that they have needs
   * survey for small groups
   * interviewing researchers about their research and along the way introducing DM topics (time intensive)
   * promote citizen science and informatics
   * RFP/RFA needs to have a requirement for a DM plan (i.e. requirements from funders)
   * open dialog
   * guidelines for DMP evaluation:  teach reviewers how to understand/review DM plans (Johns Hopkins developing a rubric to help evaluators rate/understand DM plans)
 * Metrics on pipeline (workforce), technology change impacts
   * ensuring skills exist in the community to accomodate change
 * Understanding value of the workforce (administration values individual contributions)
   * local (institutional)
   * national

Existing initiatives:

 * UK's Digital Curation Center curriculum and roadshows  http://www.dcc.ac.uk/
   * basics of data management (Data Curation 101)
   * roadshow run by DCC
 * Software Carpentry
   * mostly US/Canada but some international
   * roadshow on campus
   * franchised
   * instructors can be local
   * http://software-carpentry.org/
 * School of Data
   * self-paced
   * online modules for various tools
   * http://schoolofdata.org/learn/
 * NASA - taking datasets and subsetting them down for use on K-12 level
 * Mantra - online training for librarians for DM
   * http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/about/organisation/edl/data-library-projects/mantra
 * Lynda.com - similar to Software Carpentry
   * commercial 
   * any software
   * higher education +
   * online self-paced tutorials
 * IMLS has funded data/information literacy courses
   * Minnesota/Cornell/Purdue online (see Dean Walton's research)
   * UMass eScience
 * ESIP Shortcourses
   * http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Data_Management_Course_Outline
   * "finished" products are:

Role that DataONE can play in education/outreach:

 * Link from DataONE to some of the available tools mentioned above
 * DataONE as an advocate for data sharing, interoperability
 * Case studies
   * power of interoperability/synthesis
   * digestible success stories (positive outcomes)
   * individual researchers' positive impacts 
   * video of actual people
   * standardizing data stories, coordination (template? standards?)
     * categorize existing case studies
     * RDA engagement interest group
   * Opportunities for Data Exchange (ODE) - EU effort
 * Advocate for A vs B (open source/corporate)
   * assessment role
   * provide information rather than a recommendation from DataONE
 * Examples of good practice
   * packaged with software materials, MN materials, etc.
   * 'Dryad Lab' as an example of identifying datasets that can be scaffolded into a part of an undergrad course
   * Data Driven Learning Guides (
 * As alternative to 1- or 3- credit classes, make available plug-and-play modules
   * research
   * compliance
   * include grading rubrics in addition to the instructional material
 * MOOCs
   * identify appropriate pedagogy frameworks
   * identify content
 * DataONE currently provides 10 modules for data management, self-paced
   * thought about moving to a more online environment
   * certification/badges at completion
 * Training
   * researchers
   * librarians
   * data managers
   * policy makers
   * journal editors
   * grant administrators
   * office of research
   * K-12?
   * undergraduates
   * citizen scientists
