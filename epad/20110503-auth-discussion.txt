Agenda
------------
1. CILogon attribute embedding
    a. Can CILogon be modified to query DataONE identity service to get attributes to be embedded in X.509 certificate? 
    Yes. Can base need for Attribute lookup based on coming in through the D1 skin at CILogon.
    
    Should each of these attributes be in their own certificate extension, or under one XML blob in a single certificate extension -- could be SAML or our own homegrown XML structure.  Using the XML embedded format has advantage of allowing us to change the attribute structure from the D1 side as needed.
    
    b. Is CILogon open source?  
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cilogon/ Yes, but not easily deployed at this point.
    
    c. Can we make these changes ourselves, or do Jim and Randy need to be involved?
    Jim will make the call-out on their side.
    DataONE needs to implement a REST service to provide the necessary attributes / document for insertion into the certificate. http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/CN_APIs.html#CN_auth.getPrincipalInfo
    
2. CILogon service behavior under different browsers
    a. Under Firefox returns usercred.p12 from link (dave: firefox works same as chrome for me)
        https://cilogon.org/?skin=DataONE (DataONE skin returns PEM)
        https://cilogon.org/?skin=all (shows all the options)
        
    b. Under Chrome, launches JNLP app that downloads x509up_u501 file (pem?)
    Different skin, see default versus dataone skins
    c. Can we turn the PKCS#12 file into a PEM certificate programatically in Java?
        YPrefer PEM because then we don't need a password.
         See example code here:
             https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_libclient_java/src/main/java/org/dataone/client/auth/CertificateManager.java
             https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_libclient_java/src/test/java/org/dataone/client/auth/CertificateManagerTest.java

    Can drop IP restrictions because SSL handshake takes care of verifying access to private key.
    
3. How do we handle auditing?
    -- now that session service is eliminated, who is responsible for logging authentication?
        -- CILogon logs all auth sessions
        -- we could have the IdM service log requests from CILogon (possibly including the IP # for originating auth)
        -- we can shut down attributes if login is required

4. Probably want MNs to be able to check attributes in addition to the cert service 

5. Single point of failure?
    -- should talk about replicating CILogon service
    -- enter a story about running replica auth services (DONE; see https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/1517)
