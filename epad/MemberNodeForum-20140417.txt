Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions: 

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
 *     CN issue - phase 1 of the "tidy process" is complete; phase 2 has begun (it will take a while to complete), index has been regenerated and looks complete, now verifying content on CNs matches what is on the MNs
 
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.
 *     MN Operations documentation
 *     Mike (PISCO) - two issues: indexing and synchronization 

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:

DIGITAL CURATION SURVEY from Inna Kouper (SEAD)  --  REMINDER
If  you are involved in taking care of digital materials of any type, form  and purpose and are interested in the advancement of digital curation as  a professional field, we invite you to participate in a study that  looks at patterns of professional participation in digital curation. 
 
The survey takes about 20 min to complete and can be found at http://bit.ly/1osgTQ7
 
FEEDBACK REQUESTED FOR THE 2014 DUG MEETING ---
         We would like feedback from MN Forum members regarding what they would like to see at the DUG and how they would like to be involved.  Everyone seemed to like the MN Showcase last time.  What else would be important at the DUG?  DUG committee meets 1st Tues of month, so comments to Amber will be passed on then.
        Have a MN Forum meeting in person (yay)
        MN Showcase ideas - new MNs since the last DUG present, but have info from current MNs available on the website
        
ESIP SUMMER MEETING - JULY 8-11, 2014 IN COPPER MOUNTAIN, COLORADO  
     DUG is Sunday 7/6 and Monday 7/7, co-located with the ESIP meeting,  plans for lodging, etc. still in process.  Survey for agenda planning at the DUG website: http://www.dataone.org/dataone-users-group

    
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:

Mark (LTER) - ready to move forward, all tests went well, when tidy process is complete can move to new PASTA GMN

Ed (NKN) - registered in sandbox, next step is to insert data into MN.  Current repository uses ESRI GeoPortal to expose metadata.  
    Question about HeartBleed - do we need to do anything re: our certs?  
    Dave: only if your system itself was vulnerable
    
Corinna (GLEON) - still working, waiting a patch for VM op sys; next step: certs

Debora (PPBio) - met today, there are some issues to address with Matt and Ben; 

Mike (PISCO) - 1st part of tidy process cleaned up issues with data appearing on CN that was not on the MN



If you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed here, please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org.
