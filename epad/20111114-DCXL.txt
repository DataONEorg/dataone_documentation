Notes from 2011-11-14 on DCXL
=============================

Attending: Dave, Carly, John, Trisha

Agenda

- (Dave) comments from D1 advisory board members on project
  - forward any issues to Bill to be forwarded appropriately

- general status of DCXL

the cloud and DataScope

- DataScope is a tool that already works with Excel
  - can we leverage this to speed implementation without being tied into cloud only implementation?
  

What does DataONE need:

- High quality metadata
- Deposit data and metadata directly to DataONE,, i.e. support of the MN APIs
- Need a MN for prototyping against, must be a Tier 3+ node
- Importing content into Excel
- Consider interactions with R. e.g. organize data in Excel, then export to R - export tool will identify errors with the export
- Output from plugin should / must be "R friendly" - also generally a better archive format.

- Authentication - is there a Microsoft identity provider for InCommon?

-- Dave: look for vaguely remembered template library for excel
