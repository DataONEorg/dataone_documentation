Monday

Status of Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type schema

- 1765, 1767
- defining administrator roles from a member node perspective to update information on a CN. 
  - e.g. trusted user per member node to update capabilities
  - add administrator subject to node document

- Implementation of administrative roles for CNIdentity methods

- Add Exception type schema, separate from the dataonetypes.xsd. It's a shared message so really should be defined here.

- checksumAlgorithmList needs to be defined? Research if this is an issue.

Documentation

  Architecture 
  
  - 1961, 1983, 1985, 1986, 945, 82
  - Some adjustments required, especially bringing the use cases up to date.
  
  - Several small changes to be made for consistency (recorded as tickets)
  
  - Should change Exception InvalidToken to InvalidCredentials


  Operations

  - Needs extensive updating (Dave)
  - VM setup for both VMWare and KVM
  - CN installation update
  - MN certificate generation recipe
  - CN operation notes
  - Contact info for VM admins


d1_common_java

- checksum issue? Perhaps a case issue with name of checksum algorithm
- Correct representation of the checksum value (case)

d1_libclient_java

- review to verify optional parameters are.
- some exception refactoring
- some methods that take an exception but don't raise InvalidToken
- some methods that don't raise InsufficientResources

- higher level resource map support

- no mechanism to listGroups? 

- (Dave) Verify use case requirements for isGroup and isPublic and add these back in if necessary


d1_common_python

- checksum issue? Perhaps a case issue with name of checksum algorithm
- Correct representation of the checksum value


d1_libclient_python

- higher level resource map support


d1_processing

  Hazelcast 
  
  - security of communications between CNs for hazelcast. Need to work on this when VMs are available.

  LDAP

  - ticket #1819

  - Add nodeApproved to the type schema. 


  Synchronization

  - Seems to be working

  Replication

  - replication task should be asynchronous on CNs to avoid timeout issue
  - compare subjects convenience method in cn_common
  - need to regenerate certificates for the DEMO machines

  - (Dave) Need to determine whether production MNs will use a DataONE cert.


rest_service

  - common and libclient libraries need to be updated to common versions



indexing

- Update task generator to listen to hazelcast and utilize spring data for storing tasks
- Add rules for extraction of remaining properties from science metadata
- update test cases for rule application


log aggregation

- initial design and review


Mercury

- Blocked by indexer updates
- Verify operation of UI, especially sci meta rendering


MN Web Tester

- need a way to show the service versions (now able to show the version of the client libs)

- would be helpful to show version info on the webtester page

- need to re-add tests against symbol subjects - put into Tier3 create as subtests



Metacat

- Are tests passing?

- DEMO4 - failing on no-certificate tests. InvalidToken returned

- Will a MN ever support write operations with Public user ID? No.

- update with no-certificate gives service failure

- Delete with no certificate gives NotAuthorized


GMN

- no-certificate test returns NotAuthorized

- getChecksum


CLI

- documentation to be completed.


R-Plugin

- probably issues related. 

Tuesday
-------

Chris
- Issue with setReplicationStatus authentication

Rob 
- tier 4 tests
- business logic for obsoletes / obsoletedBy 
- Need a sequence diagram for update() operation

Skye
- refactored MN web test service page to use manifest files, falling back to jar name scraping
- started design of the CN version check
  - web apps = knb, 

Ben
- mn tester for metacat
- deleting stuff - removing the system metadata record

Robert
- multipart message problem, probably due to not using correct request object


Wednesday
---------

Chris 
- bugs in cnode service
- call on getSystemMetadata not returning consistently
  - possibly a locking issue?

Roger
- CLI work, continuing to cleanup

Ben
- metacat integration tests
- onto tier 4 tests
- xsl for rendering the REST endpoints, e.g. https://cn-dev.dataone.org/cn/v1/node

Nick
- working with Chris
- hardware config / installation work

Rob
- continuing with tests
- issues with access policy, to do with comparators

Skye
- CN version reporting tool
- d1_process_daemon tool

Robert
- CNRest service
- Debugging PUT operations not having complete request object
- 

Thursday
--------

Skye
----
 * research on the shade plugin
 * shell script route or java route for reporting different portions of jar dependencies
 * determining what the input should be (war/jar manifests, etc)
   * cn.war
   * d1_process_daemon.jar
   * knb.war
 * Robert: look at the cn/d1_cn_tools  sub directory

Roger
-----
 * finished command line client
 * starting on stress testing for any MNs

Robert
------
 * worked on params proxy issue, we hadn't run into this issue before (only proxying GETs)
 * creating a wrapper for the wrapper to handle mime-multipart portion
 * modified Subject to add compareTo(), which obviates CertificateManager.equalsDN()
 * will be committing CN changes to subversion and will be upgrading cn-dev, potentially cn-dev-2
   * changes to ldap

Rob
---
 * finished the MN web tester, latest version is up
 * are we implementing user validation? (check for symbolic user validation)
   * need to create a test account that has the validation flag set, and one not set for testing
   * test users should be registered in the D1 identity system
     * one verified, one not
 * need CN certificate in the tests for replication
 * need MN certificate different than the source
   * to test Tier4, we can have the MN tester call:
     * MN.create()
     * CN.create() immediately after (to bypass sync)
       * restrictions need to be in place for calling this
       * need to allow create and registerSystemMetadata to be exposed through cn_rest_proxy functionality
 * needs to review CN API and make tests for these calls (big job)

Ben
---
 * metacat trunk is testing Tiers 1-3 with blue/yellow success
   * Tier3 test requiring a CN cert is being ignored for now
 * Will continue work on Tier4 testing issues
   * (discussed sanbox/cert issues for tier 4 tests)

Chris
-----
 * Continued troubleshooting replication
   * resolved setReplicationStatus() problem, can be successfully called
   * resolved isNodeAuthorized() problem, can be successfully called
   * still getting timeout issues in the roundtrip transaction even though the first call 
     to replicate() is asynchronous. Will track this down today
   * hazelcast problems were likely a configuration issue: on redeployments, the configuration defaults to an internal cluster (for MNs), need to be sure it is set to connect to the D1 cluster every time we redeploy a CN


when replica is in state of completed, then we want to call the audit membernodes. anytime accesspolicy changes audit membernodes

Rob
---
CN architecture questions:
 - is assertRelation() deprecated? 
     ** Found the deprecation note in documentation. :-)
 - does pid in setOwner get passed in on the url path, or in the message body?  (architecture and method in conflict).
 - do subjects get passed in as their string value or as the object itself?
 - is status still a parameter of cn.listSubjects()?  in the code, not the docs
 - 


Friday
------

Chris

- Round trip ok, but setReplicationStatus problem. Works with curl, but failing in sync / repl.
  - problem with case of enum value, sending "COMPLETED", expecting "completed"
- tmieout issues may still be a problem - e.g. when auth fails
- Need to add a GMN instance
- More MNs and various replication policies
- More CNs

Skye

- version reporting for web apps - cmdline display
- strategies for jar dependcies

Roger

- updating stress tests for current architecture, especially certificate stuff
- updated checksum comparison
- need to verify replica information is supported by the CLI

Rob

- working on cnode API - seeing inconsistencies between client code and docs.
- perhaps use echo test 
- issue of how to do effective replication tests. Need a sandbox setup with CN and MN involved.

Ben

- working with replication testing


Replication test environment:

CNs: cn-dev.dataone.org, cn-dev-2.dataone.org 
MNs: gmn-dev.test.dataone.org, demo1, demo2

- Generate test IDs for the test data
- Need test corpus for replication data - data size x replication policy
