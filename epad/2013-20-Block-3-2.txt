Rob
---
 * 2013
 * 20130524
   * In touch with Ryan re: dev environment, haven't heard back yet
     * Needs to register in /portal and at docs.dataone.org for the certificates
 * 20130522
   * Testing Dryad - found some issues
     * Will register dev.datadryad.org in dev
   * Packaging up libclient
     * added new maven assembly goal to produce artifacts with /libs on dev-testing
     * will manually copy to rreleases.dataone.org
     * release names need to follow tag names precisely
 * 20130520 
   * Looking at the libclient jar issue (releasing a jar + libs/ tgz)
     * R client includes everything except jibx*
     * jibx is only needed for the codegen phase of the buildout
     * maven dependency list still has them listed, trying to figure out how to exclude them
 * 20130517
   * Performance testing wrapped up for very large resource maps
     * Upshot: creating is expensive with foresite, deserializing isn't
     * Perl script takes 10 seconds to serialize
     * Big impact is the high degree of cardinality for the documents field
     * Suggest review of the writeup documentation
   * Libclient discussion
     * Use maven to create a release with dependencies
     * release.dataone.org
     * JibX tools and its dependencies on Eclipse plugin arch are not needed for the execution of the jibx generated classes.
   * Will work on using hudson to create a recipe for producing product releases for common and libclient
 * 20130515
   * finishing Very Large Data Packages arch document (http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/VeryLargeDataPackage.html)
   * memory needed to build the model from the serialized form is the main limitation, and the reasoning model I use takes 3-6 times the memory, so this may need to inform our data package requirements
   * need tools for estimating resource map size prior to deserializing into a model, where the memory hit is incurred.
     * use of a solr query (q=resourceMap:{ReM}) gets the number data one objects in the resource map
     * number of objects in the map is a good indictor under normal circumstances.
 * 20130513
   * Experimenting with nested, large resource maps
     * Generation is quicker with certain techniques
     * Looking at the memory footprint - using VisualVM
     * DataPackage holds a resource map - but isn't used. Refactoring that out.
   * Will document as well

Skye
----
 * 20130524
   * Working on EML support in indexing for taxonomic coverage
   * ONEDrive: 8 taxonomic ranks? Scientific name
     * Should use the genus and species binomial for the 'scientific name' field
   * Adding in entity-attribute information from EML
     * eml-attribute description field
     * parameterDescription
     * parameterUnits
   * Will be out next week
   * Moving into Solr 4 installation work
   * Will discuss indexing with Chris today
 * 20130522
   * Rolled out replication auditor project
     * new hudson build
     * integrated into process daemon
     * has a standalone tool
   * Worked with Dave on common solr code
     * Classes will be added to d1_cn_common
     * Will be using Solr 4 Cloud service
       * cloud config provides multimaster replication
       * Be sure these Solr VMs are added to the operational procedures, layout is sane in datacenters, etc.
   * Change build tool to use database access layer
 * 20130517
   * MN forum - generated some questions re: libclient
     * Mike F. using Matlab and needs some Java/JRE assistance
   * Proposal for eceptions logging index and moving to Solr 4.x
     * Using Jetty may increase performance
   * Auditing is now split out into a single project
     * Continued work
 * 20130513
   * Upgrading production ORC and UNM machines
     * some trouble in the Solr index, ended up re-building the indices
     * cleaned out cn-specific names (like cn-ucsb-1)
     * Solr is read-dominated, updates are expensive
     * Rebuild finished Sunday - pushing through some lingering OREs
     * Some trouble with ORC - hzIdentifiers is short (200K, vs 331K)
   * Will be entering tasks on the exception logging
     * Would want to upgrade to Solr 4.x - big changes - new required field
 * 20130515
   * Proposed idea of a common location to place dataone CN utilities
     * Common place for finding indexing, auditing tools, utilities
     * /usr/share/dataone/(bin/tools) seem to be popular in su.
       * in /usr/share "application-specific, architecture-independent directories be placed here" (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard). So as long as the scripts are in perl/java/shell/python then it seems like it would be the place.
   * Splitting replication auditing into stand alone project.
     * Working on stand alone replication auditing tool.
   * Writing up proposal for new event, exception logging index service
     * solr 4 with cloud replication on jetty server...
       * seperate jvm, no additional load on the tc 
         * no additional load on metacat, indexes, cn services
       * no need for immediate migration of existing solr indexes to begin creating solr 4 install/config etc.

Dave
----
 * 
 * 20130524
     * Working with eBird helping setup for publishing annual dataset
   * OS issues - rebuilding desktop machine
   * Opportunity for working through builds of all products with empty machine
   * considering adding support for "query" method in CLI
 * 20130522
   * Will prune Metacat builds on Hudson for 7 days
     * Will delete the Metacat build, Metacat_unstable will save 10 builds
   * Catching up on the backlog
     * working on dependency diagrams
     * streamlining releases
     * could use a redmine URL for release notes
 * 20130522
   * Working through backlog of issues
   * Completing product dependencies and setting up release pages / process
 * 20130520
   * LT meeting
     * Increasing MNs and content
     * Improving discoverability and usability
   * Catchup after travel, grant reporting, etc
 * 20130517
   * LT meeting all week on strategies for next iteration of DataONE project
   * General concensus that we need to seriously consider the "slender node" concept, or a Tier0 API for MNs. Approach would be to leverage existing services or capabilities (e.g. site maps, OAI-PMH, WCS, ...) available at a repository, and have a DataONE adapter (perhaps run by DataONE) that performs translation sufficient for a repository to appear with Tier 1 capability.
   * Also Discovery is the other hot topic that is seen as essential for DataONE's future.
   * Met with UNM IT about issues with storage being offerred up. Basically we have a large amount (currently 16TB, but growable to about 1PB) of space available, but due to implementation and operational issues, is not really very useful in a production environment, except perhaps for storing backups or as scratch space.

Matt
----
 * 20130520
   * At the LT meeting last week, working on the new proposal
     * Confirmation that size is approximately 1/2
     * Dev of Core CI was key, hopeful that CI size will remain
     * CE working group - education modules, training, etc.

Ben
---
 * 20130324
   * Troubleshooting some minor logging issues with CILogon
     * slightly holding up the release
 * 20130522
   * Finished CILogon upgrade
     * deployed on cn-dev
     * servers need to be pre-registered. So, Ben registered all of the CN envs (in dataone-cn-portal)
     * minor change in d1_solr_extensions
     * for production deployments:
       * will need to upgrade dataone-cn-portal and dataone-cn-solr
 * 20130520 
   * Upgraded the CILogon code to use their new API
     * configuration is no longer RDF/XML - now plain XML
 * 20130517
   * PPBIO node will be coming online (Brazilian node)
   * 

Chris
-----
 * 20130522
   * TODO: email Bob re: DSpace
   * Deprecated mn-orc-2.dataone.org, mn-unm-2.dataone.org from the replica target MNs
     * some troubleshooting of LDAP syncrepl - updates not making it to cn-unm-1.dataone.org
     * ended up restarting slapd on unm
     * Ben - LTER upgrade and invalid pid removal with Mark S.?
   * Working on hz updater code for ORNLDAAC pids
     * testing in the dev env - can't use stage because ORNLDAAC stage MN == prod MN
     * using pids on mn-demo-5
   * Metacat-specific work
   * Put some thought into the Settings/Workspace API - need to discuss this
   * Minor coordination on Dryad MN spinup with Rob
     * Are we ready to register in stage?
     * Are we planning for a demo by Friday?
   * Will be getting back to hzIdentifiers issue, but restarted d1-processing on cn-orc-1
 * 20130520
   * Ansible walk through with Chris B.
   * discussion with Dave and Roger re: ONEDrive and a Workspace API
   * Investigating the ORC hzIdentifiers set offset after our CN upgrade last week
 * 20130517
   * Have been out this week - catching up on emails
 * 20130513
   * Metacat-specific work
   * Working with Skye on upgrading production CNs
   * Working on ORNL system metadata updates
   * Sensor best practices workshop writing

ONEDrive Discussion
-------------------
 * Workspace Type
   * XML document that supports 
     * Lists of pids
     * queries
     * folders - contain either of above
     * See an example at: https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_workspace_client/src/examples/workspace.xml
   * python library can serialize and deserialize this type - likely will be rolled into to libclient
   * Populated by logging in, and calling an API to get the workspace instance for the user
 * Initial implementation:
   * We'll use a wildcard query
   * Will implement the mockup view that matt put together (by year, by author, etc). These will be the first pass filters
   * 
User Settings API notes
 * API name: This could be the Workspace API, or Settings API, or other
 * Association with CNs/MNs
   * This could be a stand alone service and not tied to a CN or MN per se
 * Potential REST endpoints and API calls
   * The settings or workspace could be seen as a series of parameters, one being a per-subject 'collection' or 'folder' of 1) static pid lists, and 2) saved search queries
     * e.g.
     * Settings.listCollections() OR Workspace.listFolders()
       * /collections/{subject} OR
       * /folders/{subject}: 
       * returns the settings collections for a given user. Should be able to pass in a collection name parameter to limit the collections returned.  The return format would be either XML -see the schema Roger worked on), or a standardized JSON object of the same information.  Look at Badgerfish for transforming XML to JSON consistently.
 * How do we model taxonomic hierarchies?
   * We have about 8 solr fields 
   * No hierarchies are wrong/right
     * Just follow an example such as
       * EOL - may have a REST service to view taxonomy
       * GBIF
       * ITIS - has REST API
     * OR, browse by rank <-- good first stab
       * kingdom
       * phylum
       * class
       * order
       * family
       * genus
       * species
       * etc


Talk with Skye on Indexing Plans
--------------------------------

topics:

1. (P1) Foresite for parsing resource maps - redmine 3723

- Chris B has this on his schedule after Ansible


2. Generalized pattern for index processing

- pluggable pre-processing
- SOLRField class supports this
- Issue is picking up the new code in a running process - simplest is to simply add and restart.


2. a. (P2) Performance of indexing - redmine 3766
- multiple instances of SOLR can work with the same index. e.g. search instance handling public requests, then start up one or more jetty instances that can write to the index.
    - Replace the hazelcast iterator with a postgres query.
    - Improve the commit strategy refresh/rebuild

3. (Depends somewhat on #4) Upgrade to SOLR 4 and related upgrades - subtask of redmine 3764

- Cloud design - write to a single virtual instance that is manifest across the CNs.
  - would significantly reduce the hazelcast traffic since sysmeta would only be pulled by one CN
- Would require rebuilding index, perhaps some schema redesign, some new required fields (e.g. version)
- Provides a new upgrade path for solr for dataONE.  Debian packaging. (perhaps start from https://github.com/zeraholladay/solr4-tomcat-debian )


4. (P3) Refactoring the solr index schema, especially for dealing with packages - redmine 3726

Need to denormalize data as much as possible - but tradeoff is flexibility. 

- Add support for data set variables (e.g. column name and units)

- http://siren.sindice.com/documentation.html (seems a bit dated)
- http://jena.apache.org/documentation/larq/



5. OpenSearch (parallel activity - lots of design required) - redmine 3608

- Issues with state management - query, page, etc.
- Scalability of view generation using SOLR as a velocity template engine
- Example templates were fairly broken
- Seems best to havea separate java app to implement the view rendering and perhaps handle some/most of hte state information
