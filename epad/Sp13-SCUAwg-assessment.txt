Group members: Ben Birch, Denise Davis, Bob Sandusky, Carol Hoover, Ellie Read, 

Tasks:  
 * Design 4 follow-up surveys 
   * Academic Libraries 
   * Academic Librarians 
   * Federal Libraries 
   * Federal Librarians 
   * Guidelines : 
     * Questions from the baseline surveys should be kept in the follow-up 
       * Exception: Questions 56, 57, 58, and 59 in the Federal Librarians baseline should not be carried over because in the baseline survey there were 0 responses to these questions. 
     * The academic library follow-up should end up with the same questions as the federal library survey unless there are questions that don't apply to both. 
     * The academic librarians follow-up  should end up with the same questions as the federal librarians survey  unless there are questions that don't apply to both. 
     * The librarys surveys present library policies, and the librarians surveys present librarians perceptions. For every question in a library survey there should be a corresponding question in a librarians survey (and vice-versa) that allows us to see how much misalignment there is between the two points of view. 
 * Create a detailed timeline for completion of all surveys (with tasks broken down) that are scheduled to be completed before the end of year 5. 
   * Scientists/educators follow-up 
   * Early adopters baseline  
   * Academic libraries follow-up 
   * Academic librarians follow-up 
   * Federal libraries follow-up 
   * Federal librarians follow-up 
   * Data managers follow-up 

State Libraries - change in leadership with the COSLA Research & Statistics Committee. Hulen Bivens is the new chair. Action needed - reach out to Hulen to discuss COSLA partcipation in the DataOne survey process. Based on response, UTK is poised to request IRB, etc to collect data.

Seek alignment between these pairs of surveys:
Academic and federal libraries
Academic and federal librarians
Academic libraries and academic librarians
Federal libraries and federal librarians


Academic Library survey add/modify

Page 1 (informed consent information)
Generally make it more like the IC information used with the other 3 surveys.
 * Remove paragraph 1
 * Add "and that I am 18 years old or older" to the end of the final sentence that begins "By proceeding..."

 * Add after web page 3:

Modify  question on web page 4 to: 'How many NSF, NIH, NEH, other federal  agency, and foundation grants are typoically awarded on your campus each  year?'

Does your institution receive external funding for research Y/N/Don't know

Please indicate the total annual value in US Dollars of external funding received from federal agencies (NIH, NEH, NSF, IMLS, etc) and foundations for the most recent fiscal year. Response ranges need to be established.

web page 5 - last response option reword to
acquire data/data sets for repositories on or off campus

web page 6 - delete word ("reference") in response option 
Providing support for finding and citing data/data sets

web page 7 - add response options from federal survey:
Seeking data sets for repository and outreach to data set owners
Consulting or involved in either policy development or strategice planning related to research data services (RDS)
Consider changing 'on a semi-regular frequency' to 'on a regular or semi-regular basis'

Consider modifying responses on web page 8 from radio buttons to checkboxes so more than one option can be selected. (Not 100% sure this is a good idea)

web page 10 - create response list drop down from baseline survey; a set of checkboxes would allow respondents to select more than one if that seems warranted.
add "other" with text box

web page 11 + 12  -change question to align with federal library quest6
Does your library manage, or participate in managing technology infrastructure (e.g., data storage, tools for data analysis, virtual community support) that supports research data services (RDS)?

web page 12: it seems that the list of options could be greater than the 3 provided right now. Check if BL survey responses include good candidates. One to add might be 'Operating a data respository' which to me is different from data storage (implying raw file storage vs. a repository with metadata, organization, and some access/discovery capabilities)

web page 15, change "developed" to "provided" in first sentence.


Federal Library survey add/modify
quest17+20 -- remove response option column No Answer

Scientist / Educator Follow-up

Discussion about the survey deployment. The BL survey utilized a 'contact the champion' approach: we are not sure we have a list of the champions we utilized for the BL that we can re-use for the follow-up survey. We would also benefit from knowing which mailing lists it went out on.

E.g.,
Using ACRL subject group mailing lists
