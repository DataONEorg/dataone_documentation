1. Establish and enforce a mandatory data availability policy.
 * Work with publishers and other stakeholders on the establishment of a registry of journal data policies.
 * Promote the use of standardized data availability statements within articles and as part of the production checklist.

2.  Contribute to establishing community standards for data sharing. Enact and enforce them as journal policies.
 * Develop and promote common guidelines through the Committee on Publication Ethics and similar bodies.
 * Have an efficient and effective process for imposing penalties on data policy noncompliance when it is brought to light post-publication.
 * Work with publishers and other stakeholders (e.g., scholarly societies and funders) on the establishment of a registry of journal data policies around data sharing.
 * add your item here



3. Contribute to establishing community standards for data preservation. Enact and enforce them as journal policies.
 * Provide input into repository certification standards and encourage use of certified repositories.
 * add your item here



4. Provide formal channels to share data.
 * Collaborate with cross-organizational projects like SHARE (Shared Access Research Ecosystem), which is a cross-institutional coordination framework to ensure access to, preservation and reuse of, and policy compliance for funded research.
 * Allow the publication of papers that describe high-value data sets as a regular stream within existing disciplinary journals, rather than segregating such papers into specialized data journals.
 * Work with repositories on streamlining the payment of open access charges for articles and data by authors and institutions.
 * Develop guidelines (e.g. through COPE) for the operation of enclaves for sensitive data, and promote their use for data that could not otherwise not be made available for reuse.
 * Work with institutional repository groups like in the UK COAR or Open Research Data Forum (UK) as well as services like Re3, etc.
 * add your item here



5. Work with repositories to streamline data submission.
 * Publishers can work with repositories that are using APIs with standard protocols (e.g., SWORD), to create plugins (e.g., OJS Dataverse plugin) or add-ons to streamline the data publication process
 * Encourage manuscript processing system vendors to streamline the availability of data in repositories for the peer review process.
 * Neither of the above ideas recognize the factor that papers and data sets do not have a one-to-one relationship and that, if you force data sets to fit the size of a particular paper, you are actually hurting the entire scientific enterprise by fragmenting data into "smallest publishable units."  If someone collects data about a particular site for 20 years and over the course of that time publishes 15 papers, there should only be 1 data set and 15 papers... not 15 papers and 15 data sets (and likely some holes in the published data since not all the data collected was used in a paper).



6. Require appropriate citation to all data associated with a publication - both produced and used. 
 * Provide guidelines for data citation to authors based on Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, but customized to each journal 
   * Upgrade data citation to references section.
   * Use a generic citation format (note: may vary in style due to the nature of the data): Author(s), Year, Dataset Title, Data Repository or Archive, Version, Global Persistent Identifier.
 * Improve metadata standards for references to external datasets within JATS, ideally distinguishing data produced from data used.
 * Encourage CrossRef to coordinate with DataCite on recording symmetric links between publication DOIs and data DOIs in their metadata records.

7. Develop and report indicators that will support data as a first-class scholarly output. 
 * Develop conventions for combining altmetrics (e.g. views, downloads, bookmarks, citations) of articles with their associated datasets.
 * add your item here



8. Incentivize data sharing by promoting the value of data sharing. 
 * Promote articles based on higher-than-average data reuse as well as higher-than-average article readership. <- This doesn't make any sense... Soo... modeler's always win?  They after all want to use lots and lots of data?
 * Create a top 100 luminary list for data re-use to create an element of competition, profile, and also work out how to measure such things. <- not the role of a publisher
