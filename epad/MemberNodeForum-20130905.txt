Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions
    
1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
Bruce: none that I'm aware of, new minor revision coming along; CCIT meeting coming up week of 9/22/13
   
2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.

 * Mike's (PISCO) upgrade to new version of metacat - how's it going?
   * Mike:  "interesting" - worked through indexing issues on test, put in production last Monday, getting info messages for failed ID calls when indexing fails, latest from Ben is that Mike should re-index.  Generates very large amounts of log file traffic.  20K indices, fails on 1100 of those.  manually reindexed; got another 600 failures, not overlapping with first set.  Info level messages, saying something else needs to be indexed first.  Mike manually indexing precursor.  Messages coming from the resource maps; saying data or metadata file isn't indexed. Bruce to ask Ben et. al. about this issue.
 * PPBio - Debora Drucker was planning to meet with the Brazillian folks to give a general overview of DataONE and how being a MN could benefit them and us, and I haven't gotten back with her yet to see how that went (Laura)
 * 5 MNs in progress for Y5Q1: EDAC, SEAD, UKansas, NPN, and NKN (updates?)
   * Greg (NKN): Luke's been working on standing up the stack, making progress.  Next meeting 9/12/13 at 2p EDT.
   * NPN: Next meeting 9/11/13 at 3p EDT
   * Rob (EDAC): last week they had a question about the service links in their data, and they've decided to strip those out; we want to encourage them to get into testing.  
     * Question: do we normally test a production instance in staging, then move to production?  
     * Bruce: yes

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:
        Mike: working with MatLab on someone else's PC, running into problem that MatLab runs off older versions of Java, which don't work with DataONE; 
        Laura: is anyone else wanting to use MatLab
        Bruce: is on the ITK list but lower down in priority list
        Greg:  there are some of our researchers who will want to use it
        MIke:  in the newest version of MatLab, some small conflict with two jars with same name, easy enough to fix by commenting out one of those
        Rob/Mike: conversation about OLD versions of MatLab, etc. which causes things to not work together
        
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
        LTER (Mark): successfully launched staging test for Pasta GMN; best to replicate LTER data to another MN before the existing MN is deprecated; holding while we wait for this to happen and for new version of metacat
        PISCO (Mike): see above; working on deprecating the metacat side when the new one's indexing issues are fixed
        NKN (Greg): working on cleaning up some metadata for more datasets to be added to our collection

OTHER INTERESTING THINGS: 

contact points: 
NEW EMAIL contact: mninfo.dataone@gmail.com    - This email monitored by DataONE staff.  I think we might migrate to  this being the primary point of contact for MN questions so we can keep a  better handle on issues/resolutions.
