Regrets:  

Action items from last time:

Follow up on Coordinating Node issue - much work in the past several weeks to resolve
    Current status?   Issue is a synchronization issue among the 3 Coordinating Nodes, related to a network partition that occurred in Oct; we have to come up with a process to merge system metadata across the CNs and then do a long-term fix (to keep this from happening again).  (this is a complex issue)  We can do bulk transfers then do the merging on a single machine, then do bulk transfers back to source.  

Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole

Not that we're aware of.  

2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.

 * (From  11/14/13 MNF meeting - Kevin Webb):  Issue with "only results with data" checkbox in ONEMercury search - currently defaults to checked;  see  redmine ticket https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4144.
 * Mark:  holding off on PASTA GMN until the CN synch is fixed.

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:

IDCC MN workshop: Thursday Feb 27th, San Francisco, CA.  In conjunction with  the International Digital Curation Conference (Tuesday and Wednesday of that week).  People at prospective MN's interested in getting involved with DataONE are encouraged to attend:  

 * For details of the DataONE workshop and the other workshops, see http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc14/workshops%20

 * For more information about the IDCC conference and registration, see:

    No cost for the workshop itself.  You don't have to be registered for the conference ($$) to attend the workshop.  Deadline for registration: 7 February 2014

FEEDBACK REQUESTED FOR THE 2014 DUG MEETING ---

    We would like feedback from MN Forum members regarding what they would like to see at the DUG and how they would like to be involved.  Everyone seemed to like the MN Showcase last time.  What else would be important at the DUG?  DUG committee meets 1st Tues of month, so comments to Amber will be passed on then.

ESIP SUMMER MEETING - JULY 8-11, 2014 IN COPPER MOUNTAIN, COLORADO  
    DUG is Sunday 7/6 and Monday 7/7, co-located with the ESIP meeting, plans for lodging, etc. still in process.  


4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:

Mark (LTER) - Business as usual (see above re: holding off on transition to GMN)

Ryan (Dryad) - certificates issued for dev work in sandbox/dev/staging, but need a separate certificate for production.  Dryad is waiting to tie their production system to DataONE staging to do some final testing - can use the same certificate they used in dev.  They will need a new certificate for production, and we will generate them asap so that this is not a holdup.  

Matt - PPBio in Brazil, we think we're close to having them technologically set up again after their server move.

        SAEON in South Africa - they've gotten new h/w for their systems and hope they're ready to move forward
        
Chris - working with Bob at University of Illinois - Chicago


If  you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed here,   please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org or  mnforum@dataone.org.

contact points: 

NEW EMAIL contact: mninfo.dataone@gmail.com  - This email monitored by DataONE staff.  I think we might migrate to  this being the primary point of contact for MN questions so we can keep   a better handle on issues/resolutions. 

This isn't being used currently - most of the time we (MNs) just email the person we know or who we're working with.  

Laura - lmoyers1@utk.edu 865.974-7931 and/or 
Bruce - bwilso27@utk.edu 865-574-6651
