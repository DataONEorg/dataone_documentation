        - A MN showcase speed session where each MN can present a short (~3 slide) summary of the MN and interesting activities
        If you are planning to  attend the DUG and you want to participate in the MN showcase there, please let us know so we can help you prepare your slides, etc.  Even if  you're NOT attending the DUG, if you'd like for your MN to be  showcased, let us know and we can present for you.
        - A poster session during the reception starting at 16:30 on Sunday, July 7, where longer, informal discussions can occur.
