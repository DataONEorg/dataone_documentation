Agenda

1. NSF  Review:  short script for the long movie showing UV-CDAT functions (Jorge)
    Yaxing will add information about the graphs / maps and their interprestation 
    
2.  EVA subgroup activities (Aritra)


3.  UV-CDAT code availability
    linked to LLNL repository and containing Jorge's work
    
    UV-CDAT 1.2.0 official release doesn't "fully" include the functions that Jorge developed.
    Next
    
    UVCDAT Video tutorials:
    http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/wiki/VideoTutorials
    http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/presentations/
    
    next release in April, will include both Jorge's and Aritra's functionality

EVA Subgroup Activities
1.  machine learning and visualization interactions
     Forrest Hoffman, Bill Hargrove, Jorge, Harish, Claudio, Vineet, Arthur, Christopher, Bob

startup again in April, 
use existing tools


2.  Evaluation/Review of visualization techniques for climate community experts
     Aritra leads, with volunteers
         Anna, Debbie, Steve, Yaxing, Dan Ricciuto, Forrest, Claudio, Bob Cook

list of figures (~50) and their advantages / disadvantages
develop a set of questions about the figures / maps

bring the group together for discussions (teleconference)

Chris Field with Anna at Standford has a IPCC library for generating IPCC plots. 
http://dge.stanford.edu/people/cfield

March 31 (for review)
conference in October 2014
IEEE Vis
http://ieeevis.org/

has an abstract / outline and the list of figures



3. A working group/focus group/proposal on the visualization needs for multiple-dimensional  Scaling
    metric and non-metric

place a group of (1) models or  (2) models and observations in the same phase space for intercomparison

    potential method for looking at ILAMB processes
    
    Vineet, Debbie, Bill Hargrove, Anna?, Jorge, Claudio
    
    
4.  (Day 2) Expand on the DataONE Provenance-Workflow (VisTrails) demo  (Yaxing et al) to show DataONE tool & infrastructure integration
lead by Prov / Workflow Working Group, tie in to the EVA WG
Bertram and Yaxing and Colin
link to Brokering approach (Stefano Nativi, Italian National Research Counsil)


5. (Maybe) a paper focusing on the visualization needs of policy makers.
    need to engage resource managers / social scientists to identify types of analysis and visualizations

    Anna, Arthur, Debbie, Bill, Steve Aulenbach, Jeff Morisette (??),
