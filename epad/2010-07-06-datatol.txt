Participants:  Anand, Biva, Saumen, Paolo,  Ilkay, Manish, Bertram, Lei

* Report from Anand
1) Querying Kepler SDF native provenance information writing my own code  and using existent QueryAPI. Documentation to that soon coming up.
2)My view of modified Kepler local provenance schema  which can be conveniently  mapped to the shared provenance schema. Right  now I have shown only the  traceland view. The workflowland view  remains the same.
3)Reading paolo's explainations and documents  from last meeting(along with some other literature readings). 

* Multiple runs? OK to keep;
create unique id at time of "pushing run button"; can have multiple invocations (both in Kepler and Taverna)

* Report from Biva
- Paolo: please summarize :)

* Report from Saumen:
Sorted out issues with Kepler2.0/COMAD and Provenance Browser for FPC
(previous report:
 Developed the conceptual schema
- Installed COMAD and ran FPC1, FPC2, and FPC3
- Installed ProvenanceBrowser with MySQL and loaded the FPC1.trace  into the database.
- Read opm1.01 paper
- Read papers on comad )

Conceptual Model: Workflows and Provenance: 
[http://groups.google.com/group/datatol/web/wf-prov-model.pdf?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fdatatol%3F]

* Manish:
==> i-depends -- shouldn't it be "outsider provenance"
==> associate data-item D with the unique run-id that generated D
==> Saumen: or even finer-grained with invocation-id! 

Saumen: What about parameters? 
==> to be resolved

* What about stitching multiple runs together?
* Paolo: global schema creates unique name space 
Linked Data Conventions,
registration of local data is OK
Would TinyURL do the trick?
Paolo: there's more than the id-generation;
instead there's <URI,content-type>
also have "same-as"

Alice, Bob, Charlie Use Case:
http://groups.google.com/group/datatol/browse_thread/thread/35fdef54351c7d9f

Synopsis: Bob uses Alice's data in his workflow. Charlie knows it after looking at Bob's provenance.

Issue with mappings and going from global to local and maintaing continuity.

Database Server Issue

* NEXT ACTIONS

==> Saumen (coordinator) to work with Anand and Biva to implement the relational schema of the SPS
(Manish to consult)

Some steps from Paolo's scenario (see there for details):
> publish data 
> get new refs
> put into trace
> publish trace

==> Anand to develop "upload utility" for Kepler (based on Paolo's for Taverna)

you are welcome to stare at this code for inspiration:
http://mygrid-labs.googlecode.com/svn/provenance-client/trunk/src/main/java/net/sf/taverna/t2/provenance/api/client/OPMDataUploader.java

Broader goals:

1- translate your CM to a relational model
2- implement the relational schema on some public server (mySQL)?
3- write code logic to map local provenance traces (each of the three "lands") onto the common schema
4- show ability to query "end-to-end" provenance across two traces seamlessly
