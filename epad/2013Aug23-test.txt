Key Milestones:
·       Continue to develop and evaluate SeaIce.
·       Further develop preservation policy/documentation.
·       Seek additional support (hopefully grant funding).
·       Disseminate findings to the DataONE community and the broader scholarly and scientific community.
 
Goals for year 5:
·       Year 5 2013/2014 – Continue developing and experimenting with SeaIce, Metadictionary (http://seaice.herokuapp.com/).  Further develop heuristics for term class (canonical, vernacular, and deprecated), voting impacts, and activity intervals.
o   Jane is integrating the use of SeaIce into her core class, INLS 520, Organization of Information.
o   New SILS/UNC  doctoral student, Deborah Maron, is also experimenting with SeaIce and will help develop module for testing
o   PAMWG user sub-group [Jane lead] will continue to develop user scenarios.
o   PAMWG technical sub-group [John lead] will continue to expand and test technology.  Nassib Nassar, UNC, is able to devote a percentage of his work-time to continuing the work of this summer’s DataONE intern, Christopher Patton.
·       Summer/fall 2013 – Submit results of Murillo, et al, study from previous DataONE internship to PLOS jrnl.
·       Year 5 2013/2014 – Explore funding/grant options (NSF, IMLS, potentially SLOAN).  Looking specifically at NSF RCN’s as one option, although less enthusiastic at the moment than we were initially; an IMLS Laura Busch award option has emerged, in coordination w/Drexel and Catholic U., due Dec. 31, 2013.  Grant options may also emerge more concretely via RDA.
·       Year 5 2013/2014 – Continue with documentation of preservation activities.  The Dryad Preservation WG (http://wiki.datadryad.org/Preservation_working_group_2013), and earlier work this year on replication w/in DataONE are helping to inform this work.  This fall, we need to revisit this work more concretely, as your efforts have focused more on SeaIce this year.  PAMWG recognizes the need to pursue this and also integrate in PID activities.  PAMWG members, John Kunze, Jane Greenberg, and Angela Murillo will be at iPRES, and this will allow for the WG to meet and re-work plans in this area.
 * Fall 2013 –  PAMWG committee participation in DataONE all-hands-meeting in New Mexico. 
 * Fall 2013,      Sept. – Participate in the Dublin Core/RDA      CAMP-4-DATA, Lisbon, Portugal. 
 * Fall 2013 – Explore      link between PAMWG and other DataONE WG (e.g., Provenance), the RDA      (Research Data Alliance) Metadata WG and IG, and other RDA groups.  We will use the AHM as a chance to      continue dialog in person w/Provenance group. 
 * Fall 2013, Nov. – J.      Greenberg, Participate in ASIST metadata research forum and report on      DataONE/HIVE and DFC HIVE synergy. 
 * Spring/Summer      2014 – Continue with testing and development of      SeaIce 
 * Spring/Summer      2014 – Run more formal SeaIce evaluation, based on      lessons learned from in-class testing. 
 * Spring/Summer      2014 – Continue to disseminate work via scholarly      and scientific venues. 
 * Spring/Summer      2014 – Revisit grant options following on work      pursued during the fall 2013. 
 * Spring/Summer      2014 – Explore potential for another student      intern.
