MacKenzie Smith, Suzie Allard, Bill Michener 

Welcome participants and introduce the meeting.
·      Welcome to the meeting
·      Ask each participant to briefly introduce himself/herself 
·      Share impetus – why this focus at this time?
 
By the end of year 5, funding is cut from $20M to $10M and need to determine the focus for DataONE and initiate the avenues for additional funding. Insights from Abby and MacKenzie led to DataONE is a complex beast and the pieces may be marketable. Need to define what DataONE is and where to put the effort. Weren’t ready to bring in a business consultant yet for a business plan.  This is an intermediate step of strategic planning to determine what the focus should be. Personnas were background material but this is a new opportunity to review stakeholder perspective.

Truncated the day so no emails during exercises

Kim Thanos: intro:
- What is the sustainable funding approach for DataONE
- Which elements of the DataONE offering that are the critical drivers for sustainability
- What is needed to  most effectively operationalize the sustainability approach?

Current reseracher versus future researcher (we are in a changing environment)
Problems vs. opportuniities

Uniquely provided by DataONE?

Best provided by DataONE?


What other providers are 
contributing?


Which issues address most 
effectively?


What is missing in offering?



=========================================================================
Bill's presentation

Common thread: 
Enabling layer


======================================================================
Offerings:
CN
MN
ITK
Community 

What elements of the offering address my issues?
 * uniquely
 * best

VP Research  &  Librarian:

1. Budget: 

 * Provides a way for institutions to engage in these new initatives without a large budget
 * Access to data -
 * When to build your own and when do you outsource?
 * Make sure their research is widely distributed
 * Unique: vertical integration of the piece of the pie
 * The organization itself - the diversity of the community

2. Workforce:
DataONE as a model - does help with the issue

3. Credit/Value:
Does help with the relevance issue
Another measure of impact 
Would like the discovery layer for all the different domains

4. Risk Management:
Does help with the compliance issue (DMPTool)

5. Governance/Decision Making
Model for collaboration

Helps the access issue - but this is not one of the issues
Does it solve the issue of where faculty & researchers can put data?  No 
Unless the institution becomes a MN  - then it helps with the preservation

Would selecting DuraSpace as one of the next MNs help?
Only solves the problem within a particular domain - again the use of DataONE as a model

Voice for advocacy

Library as matchmaker - place for researchers to put their data
DSpace may not be the long-term solution for a variety of disciplines

Funders:

ROI

Roles & Responsibilities

Wants to add MNs to get more exposure for their data
Tools in the ITK
Community: have people working for the funder attend DUG and find a broader perspective


What does it mean to sustain DataONE?
What is the cost of sustaining DataONE? 

Through citation tracking can show ROI
