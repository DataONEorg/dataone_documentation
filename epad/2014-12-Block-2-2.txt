   * Jenkins: got 
 * 20140326
   * EDAC - loaded more datasets, will see how harvesting went.
     * Q. replication policy is set to false?
   * Tidy: implemented new authMN column in merge_Result.  test run 10001 finished successfully (0 failures)
   * Jenkins - working through installation
     * Q: do we need tomcat?
       * apparently not -> K.I.S.S.
 * 20140318
   * EDAC: they need time to build data packages, so it would be difficult to test all of their collection quickly.  (approx 280000 items, about 13Tb worth of data).
     * their data packages are: 1 zip file, 1 FGDC file, 1 resource map - so the data package is delivered pre-assembled.
   * Tidy: added special handling for OBJECT_FORMAT.1.1 file

 * 20140321
   * I've updated the documentation for Python 2.7.
   * Refactoring the GMN documentation to create two separate sections, one for standalone installation and an additional section to bring the standalone instance into a D1 environment. Much less confusing.

   * Will be out next week. Back Monday March 31.
 * 20140317
   * Fixed PyPI installation warnings by generating a MANIFEST file that includes each file that should be included instead of a MANIFEST.in file that excludes files that should not be included.


Chris
-----
 * 20140326
   * still dealing with CN pid indexing. restoring the db has been super slow because of indices. Wrote script to drop all indices and constraints to just get to the data.

     * Upgrades went well in stage.
     * cn-stage-ucsb-1 continues to not replicate data via LDAP. Kept out of RR.
     * ORC VMs seem to be in need of patching compared to UNM and UCSB. Patched now, but talk with David.

Jing
----
 * 20140324
   * Fixed an issue to rename a ldap entry which DN starts with "cn=".
   * Test metacat on ubuntu. Morpho.10.1 always froze. I suspect it is caused by openjdk.
 * 20140321
   * Ran the program again ldap-dev server twice. Found and fixed some bugs.
   * Installed a virtualbox ubuntu 12.04, and apache 2, tomcat 7 and openjdk-7 on it. Finished the configuration of them. Just installed metacat and will configure and test it.
 * 20140317
   * Comparing the accounts in NCEAS' ldap server manually

   * started compiling evaluation data of Solr 4 into a document - this will be made available via EtherPad for comments/evaluation by any/all


Discussion Topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenJDK Issues
 * Connecting to Metacat
 * There's a problem with both HTTP and HTTPS connections inder OpenJDK 7
   * symptom: Morpho is frozen 

Counting CN data:
 * Total # of data, metadata, maps. Every 30days since we started.
   * listObjects() doesn't completely work because we can't slice by dateUploaded
   * Solr index can't work because it doesn't have archived pids
   * Will need to construcct a SQL query, and wrap it in a script (Chris)

Operating System Upgrades
 * See and add to story https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4466
 * Having newest software is desirable
   * 14.04.0 on the servers may not be an issue
   * Dave: Go to 12.04 first?
     * Robert: Fresh 14.04 installs will enable better (LVM-based) backups
     * Going to 12.04 enables us to upgrade fairly easily
     * Filesystems should be partitioned consistently (we can do this with fresh installs)
     * Software packages should be consistent
     * Fresh install requires data migration (PostgreSQL, Filesystem, etc.)
     * New hardware may not be in place yet for a straight install of 14.04
   * Roger: what about upgrading one at a time (mixed 10.04/12.04 env)?
   * DECISION: Upgrade to 12.04 first, then schedule upgrades to 14.04 in 6 months
   * DECISION: Do fresh installs of 12.04? No, we run a dist-upgrade
   * DECISION: Once upgraded to 12.04, we have the ability to move Ansible orchestation forward. Ansible will not be used to upgrade to 12.04
   * TODO: Ensure CN installation for 10.04 is complete/up to date (Robert)
   * DECISION: Migrate Hudson to Jenkins and install build (https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4478)
     * Create a dedicated VM for build and mvn distribution. 
     * Use of Artifactory or Apache Archiva for Maven Build Artifact Repository Manager. (robert create task)
     * Migrate off of OpenLDAP for unit tests, move to embedded apache LDAP
 * Base install vs upgrade
   * Current CN upgrade roadmap (10.04 --> 12.04 --> 14.04 ?)
   * New CN environments with new 14.04 base installs?
   * 
 * Upgrade to Java 7
   * OpenJDK 7 or Oracle JDK 7?
     * Oracle JDK includes proprietary components
     * We promote FOSS systems, so would prefer OpenJDK 7
       * Needs testing
     * Considerations for CILogon, certificate handling, libraries, etc. (BouncyCastle)
       * Needs testing
       * Can we remove BouncyCastle from our installation stack and dependency chain
 * Upgrade to Tomcat 7
   * possible optimization for CN Rest Service becuase of limitations of Tomcat 6
 * Upgrade to PostgreSQL 9
   * Portal servlet needs testing under PG 9, Java 7
 * Upgrade to OpenLDAP
   * take out workaround for bug in 10.04 Openldap
 * Upgrade to Hazelcast 3.x? No
   * Better serialization
   * Feature to not use locks (RPC call to owner member for write?)
   * DECISION: stick with 2.x series for near future
 * d1_common_java and d1_libclient_java issues
   * TODO: Add ticket for upgrading jibx (Robert)
 * Metacat installation issues
   * Jing might be able to test out the use of Metacat with Java 7, Tomcat 7, PostgresSQL 9 and report back to us
 * Scheduling
   * CN consistency is completed (week of Mar 17-21)
   * Ensure Java 7 works on workstations (builds all components) (Week of Mar 24-28)
   * Migration to Jenkins, building with Java 7 (Week of Mar 24-28)
   * OS upgrades to 12.04 in DEV (week of Mar 31 - Apr 4)
   * Ubuntu 14.04 install: Delayed for 6 months
     * Dailys available now: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily/current/
     * Final Beta available March 27, 2014
     * Release candidate available April 10, 2014
     * Final release April 17, 2014
   * What should our schedule be in lieu of this?
