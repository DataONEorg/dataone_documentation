21 June 2013                                      

Attendees:  Laura, John, Rebecca, Amber

Regrets:  Dave

Agenda: 
        1. High profile issues
            - SEAD - conference call with NCED Wednesday (12 June 14:00 EDT)
            UPDATE:  It looks like SEAD is ready to move to production, dependent upon NCED's willingness to make their metadata available via DataONE while retaining downloading capability at NCED (as in initial implementation).  
                  Action Items:  Date to reconfirm with SEAD? Pulse SEAD on or around June 27
                  
            2. Status of MNs (MNs like this are high probability for making Y4Q4)
            "In Progress" and "Testing" MNs for Y4Q4 are:
             Dryad (3118) - a/o 6/17/13: calling Ryan soon. 
                     near miss requests are hitting instead of erroring RM#3774
                         May present a poster at DUG
            SEAD (3521) - a/o 6/17/13:  see above.
            EDAC (3221) - see discussion from LT mtg 6/21/13
                EDAC suggests conversations early on in the process re: data management.
                Concerns about data management (i.e. how EDAC stores their data vs. how DataONE expects to receive data) related to real-time data output creation
            University of Kansas (3188) - a/o 6/13/13: KU is reporting that metadata generation is completed, and are in the  process of some final internal configuration. Should be in a position to  start moving forward with stage testing soon, perhaps next week.
                6/18: Some question about augmenting science metadata. Suggest to handle incrementally RM#3550 (Dave?)
            
            "In Review" MNs for Y4Q4 and suggested priorities are:
             PPBio (3748) - (John to follow-up w/David Dias) (UPDATE?)  up priority on PPBio
             USANPN (3186) - a/o 6/21/13: Waiting on NPN: need word back from Bruce
             TFRI (3201) - a/o 6/7/13: Ben Leinfelder working with them - some "minor" metadata issues to clean up, then will move to production (perhaps next week) 
                             6/18-6/19: Reported "gone production" RM#3201
                                 confirmed?
                                 MN description doc? RM#3202
                                 update external web MN list?  
                Action Item: We need to advertise - on website, etc. - that TFRI is our newest MN, develop press release, "welcome", nugget for NSF  Laura to start a blurb.

QUESTION: how do you know you're finished with one phase and ready to move to the next phase (you don't have to pass all "tests" to move on)
             NKN (3688) - a/o 5/31/13: Rebecca to meet with Janine Salwasser - Oregon Explorer program at OSU mid June for more info. Actually need to separate this from NKN (they're only loosely connected with NKN) - OE might be better when we have MN in a box, call them a new prospective MN (create redmine ticket)
                 NKN - meeting 6/18/13

             
             Follow-up on remaining Y4Q4 prospective MNs:
            
             AOOS (Alaska Ocean Observing System) (3531) - From Matt:  This is for a project I have working with AOOS, and we have deployed a Metacat instance that is in testing.  The node is located here for now:  https://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/evos.  Several things need to happen before this node goes production, including: 1) rebrand the site as AOOS;  2) move the node to a stable AOOS address; and 3) get signoff from the AOOS folks that they are ready to have it go live.  Ben and I have managed this server thus far, and so it should be straightforward to bring this node up once the ducks are in a row.
             Action Item: Needs follow-up and reconfirmation of status and prospect.
             
             TERN (Taiwan Ecological Research Network) (3211) - check w/Ben, redmine ticket 3211
             From Matt:  TERN and TFRI are separate nodes, but run by related groups in Taiwain.  They are both Metacat installations there that have been running for many years. The TFRI node is moving forward with MN implementation, and Ben has been in contact with them.  I don't know the status of the TERN node.  
             From Laura:  TFRI LIVE this week!!  c.f. note in ILTER-Israel below.  
             From Ben (redmine): From Dr Chau Chin Lin:  In terms of TERN Metacat to join DataOne, we are planning to have TERN as the service of ILTER data portal and still discussing. As you know ILTER has an IM Committee, David Blankman is serving as the Chair currently. We will discuss this in ILTER annual meeting in the coming Oct in Korea. Yes, I will let you know and work with you if there is a final result.
                 Action item: Laura talk to Suzie re TERN(AUS) and TERN(Taiwan)
             
             ILTER (International LTER - Israel) (3233) - From Matt:  I wrote to David Blankman (ILTER POC) last week about these nodes (Israel and Europe), and will follow up with him again.  
             Matt noted in redmine, David says that "LTER-Europe would definitely be interested in becoming part of DataOne. There is also an Asia-Pacific metacat that TERN/Taiwan is managing that should be a DataOne node as well."  
             POINT OF CONFUSION (for me, anyway) - OK, are we implementing Israel and Europe separately, even though Israel is considered part of the Europe region?
             
             SAEON (South African Environmental Observation Network) - From Matt: Ben has worked with these folks consistently, and helped establish a Metacat node there in Cape Town, but we need to follow up with them to get it done.  They seemed amenable when we have spoken in the past.
        
Action Item: JWC and LM contact Matt to better coordinate.

             Y5Q2: USGS Topo maps - a/o 6/7/13: Mike Frame says looks like it will  be Fall sometime before they can proceed.  Moved out beyond Y4Q4  to  Y5Q2

            Operational Nodes:
                SANParks: went offline. server DNS resolution failure RM#3814
                LTER:  13K+ objects report "not authorized" on synchronization even though marked public read RM#3815 (really not a problem because these records are legitimately not for public consumption)
                USGS CSAS: (from Mike Frame)
                "Mike: For later discussion - Won't be on the full MN call (can stay for first 15 minutes), but would like to get an update on the CSAS MN reindexing, and error issues. Record below is still showing errors:
https://cn.dataone.org/onemercury/send/xsltText2?pid=nrdata.nps.gov_gos_2166812.xml&fileURL=https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/nrdata.nps.gov_gos_2166812.xml&full_datasource=USGS%20Core%20Sciences%20Clearinghouse&full_queryString=%20*%20AND%20has%20data%20AND%20%28%20datasource%20:%28%20urn:node:USGSCSAS%20%20%29%20%29%20&ds_id="
(RM#3724)

        3. Old action items
            ACTION ITEM: Poll MN's for what is of value to them in DataONE  participation (how to accomplish this? - MN forum topic?) prepare for DUG time-frame, we need to identify 1) what we need to know, 2) questions to ask to find that out, 3) format for asking those questions (survey monkey?, other?) - maybe get with Suzie et. al. for guidance?
            ALL: look at open redmine tickets for MNDeployment and ensure they are assigned to the right person  looks like this is done (i.e. I don't see Dave responsible for everything.  :)
            ACTION ITEM: Laura to follow up on the Y4Q4 outliers (AOOS, SAEON, ILTER, TERN) - done
            ACTION ITEM: John Call/Contact Ryan at Dryad with "how's it going?"
            
            ACTION  ITEM:  Rhetorical consistency. LTER node is really the LTER Network Office  (LNO) Member node. Hmm. what needs changing? Well. the MN description  for one. Need to coordinate with LTER Network  Office on what to  change.  Laura to collect all "LTER" related info to  try to sort out  what's what, share this info with MNW for clarity before  contacting  LNO.

Here's  what I've discovered so far:  The MN we have is the LTER Network  Office, the US  LTER "member" of ILTER.  ILTER (the international LTER  network of networks) consists of 5 regions (North America, South  America, Europe, Africa, East Asia/Pacific), each of which has member  "nodes" in various countries.  Currently we have redmine tickets for: 
    ILTER-Europe (3232)
    ILTER-Israel (3233) (Israel is considered part of Europe - who knew?)
    SAEON (3205) South Africa
    PELD (3203) deferred due to "overlap" with PPBio, but I don't understand PPBio's relationship to ILTER??
    TERN (3211) Taiwan Eco Research Network
    
QUESTIONS/COMMENTS:  
 * What is our ultimate goal re: ILTER and DataONE MNs?  Regional ILTERs  (NA, SA, Europe, Africa, EAP) or country LTERs (i.e. Israel, Brazil,  South Africa, etc.)? A mix depending upon individual need and interest?
 * I don't think the MN desc doc for LTER needs to change, as it accurately describes the US LTER.  We just all need to understand that LTER is only the US network.
