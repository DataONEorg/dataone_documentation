Earthcube Interoperability Testbed Breakout
---------------------------------------------------------------
Participants:
Liping Di, Reagan Moore, Janet Frederick, Chris MacDermand, David Arctur, Scott Peckham, Matt Jones, Jeff Horsbugh, Bill Rideout, Kelly Eicher, Yong Liu

Repositories and systems in use
----------------------------------------------
Ground based radar
CUASHI HIS
DataONE
Kepler
CSDMS -- community surface dynamics modeling system
    -- interoperable components
    -- model interoperability
    -- CCA -- common component architecture
-- ESMF -- Earth Science Modeling Framework
-- OGC services and standards
-- Woods Hole Coastal observatory (IOOS, uses SOS)
-- HFR radar, ionosphere
-- policy based data management and processing (iRODS)
-- agriculture and sensor data -- data repository and modeling
-- citizen science data
-- GEOSS brokering service -- describes data access services available at GEOSS providers
    -- two stages to access: discovery, then resolve and access services to get data
-- OGC PubSub standards working group
-- GI Cat -- italy, integrated with CUASHI system and other large scale networks
-- OGC CSW -- multiple catalog profiles -- ebRim, simple, etc.

Levels of Interoperability
-----------------------------------
-Repositories
    -- Access services
    -- Data semantics
-Workflows
-Catalogs
-Models

Potential testbed activities
--------------------------------------
Prototype goals
1) What interoperability can we acheive today among existing repository servers?
2) What does the prototyping tell us about what we can and should do better?

-- interoperable discovery
-- data and service interoperability
-- service to service interoperability
-- workflow interoperability

-- drive from an end-to-end scenario
    -- data/sensor to data fusion to model/workflow run
