Skye
------
 * 20140414
   * Production index rebuild post op
     * pushing through some docs that did not process due to ucsb issues

Rob
---
 * 20140425
   * d1_integration tests - refactoring code 
     * 
 * 20140423
   * Working on improvements to d1_integration tier testing as it relates to testing Metacat (a tier3 node) for the OS upgrades.  
     * will need to add option to specify the testing environment the node is registered to in order to both provide the MN the right CN client certificate, and also to give better test results for methods that will differ in their response depending on their tier.
 * 20140418
   * CCI 1.2.6 release - branches created, and build artifacts
     * 
 * 20140416
 * CCI 1.2.6 release - minor complexities related to releasing tags:
   * incomplete unit tests for new features / classes:
     * completed unit tests for Comparators, made conformant to the contract and recommendations for behavior
     * created testcase for ChecksumUtil class
   * d1_test_resources in trunk introduced java classes related to features in CN components unrelated to this release, so I'm merging a resource from trunk to latest branch to avoid creating a new branch for d1_test_resources, and having to review new java code.
 * Member Node integration tests:
   * helping Jing test mn-demo-11, uncovered shortcomings with testing related to using the right CN client certificate for the node. 
 * Member Node support - need to follow up with them.
 * 20140414
   * CCI 1.2.6 release
     * d1_common_java: waiting for testing of DateTimeMarshaller timezone pattern to finish
     * d1_libclient_java: will refactor the systemmetadata comparator names to use full datatype names
     * will make branches of each for testing by CN components. 

Jing

Topics
~~~~~~
d1_common_java and d1_libclient_java CN testing tickets
 * Comparators need to be fixed (equals needs to be implemented correctly) - not an issue.  
 * 

hzIdentifiers set in production is rising in count
 * listObjects() shows a greater number than the hzIdentifiers set
   * Robert will be running a repair that will show what pids aren't in the hzIdentifiers set
   * Check the default ISet behavior WRT evictions

Setting up CN testing
 * discuss hzProcess spin up

CN Upgrade dependency issues: Jing
 * Solution: build the unstable channel on Jenkins, using 12.04, TC 7, Java 7, pull from the branch Jing created (vs trunk)

MN.systemMetadataChanged() API documentation and impl discussion: Rob
Testing MN.getLogRecords()
