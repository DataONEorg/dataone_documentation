Agenda:

1) Update on Charter (Procedural Guidelines) Process
 * now on website
 * waiting on a few pieces for newsletter before sending to DUG by email, will link to charter
 * full membership now listed on DataONE site - http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DUGMembership.pdf
 * verify member information through DUG meeting registration and then follow-up with others after
2) DUG Member Recruitment
 * about 8 members have come in through button website
 * need to make website easier, more simple, on the front page
 * distinction between community mailing list versus DUG mailing list
   * Bill prefers consolidation
   * 5,149 people on community list right now, lots of known junk/dups in mailing list
   * 150 or so people on DUG list now
   * idea of going with an opt-out
   * idea of sending an email to the community list with an opt-in pointer to website registration
   * perhaps...
     * single communication channel (combined community list and DUG)
     * DUG is about who has been and goes to meetings
 * maintaining two lists isn't so bad, perhaps encourage registration on DUG list at AHM 
 * need to increase communications, make more visible, easier to register, auto-response
 * need to clarify representation of DUG list vs community list
   * community list just for receiving information
   * DUG is higher-level of engagement, annual meeting, etc.
3) Steering Committee
 * role - help to shape, direct activities of DUG annual meeting, help to motivate and organize broader DUG involvement
 * structure - discuss frequency of meeting at the meeting
   * Amber will setup call details
   * Andrew will send Doodle poll
   * after AHM
4) Goals for AHM (agenda: http://bit.ly/GJ7pPl)
 * choose sessions and kind of float around
 * need to let Amber know what we'd like her to cover for DUG in her update (a couple of slides)
