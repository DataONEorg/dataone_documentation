(Stacy's comments below for us to review)
Prior to workshop:
 * Online survey to evaluate perceived norms and personal practices related to each workshop theme
   * Example – QA/QC:    
   * Based on your experience, how much effort do researchers in your field typically invest into ensuring or data quality (e.g. checking for errors during data entry, using statistical and/or graphical approaches to identifying outliers or erroneous values)
     * Researchers in my field don’t do anything to ensure data quality --> researchers in my field have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies to help ensure data quality
   * How much effort do you personally invest into ensuring the quality of data you collect or checking the quality of other data you work with?
     * I don’t do anything to ensure or check data quality à I have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies to help ensure data quality
   * Please describe procedures you implement and/or technologies you use to ensure or check data quality.
   * 
During workshop (after each segment):
 * Online or paper survey with a segment focused on the most recently presented workshop theme
   * During this session, we presented the following as best practices:
     * …
     * …
     * …
   * Do you foresee obstacles to implementing these best practices in your work? How difficult do you think it will be to overcome these obstacles?
     * I am already doing this + Likert scale ranging from ‘may require some work to implement, but no serious obstacles’ to ‘insurmountable obstacles’ + not applicable to my work
   * Please provide more information about the serious obstacles that you see to implementing these best practices in your work.
 * 
At end of workshop:
 * Online survey with a segment focused on each workshop theme
   * Based on your experience, how much effort do researchers in your field typically invest into ensuring or data quality (e.g. checking for errors during data entry, using statistical and/or graphical approaches to identifying outliers or erroneous values)
     * Researchers in my field don’t do anything to ensure data quality à researchers in my field have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies to help ensure data quality
   * How much effort do you personally invest into ensuring the quality of data you collect or checking the quality of other data you work with?
     * I don’t do anything to ensure or check data quality à I have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies to help ensure data quality
   * Please describe any changes you plan to make in your efforts to ensure or check data quality based upon things you’ve learned during this workshop.
   * 
Ideas for pre-assessment from UCBoulder survey
•       Briefly describe your research. 
•       How long have you been conducting this type of research? 
•       Can you tell us a little about what sort of data your research produces? 
•       How is the data stored and accessed after it is produced? 
•       Who has access to this data? 
•       Does your department/lab have procedures in place for the preservation of researchers’ data in the event they leave the university or pass away? 
 - Expectations?
