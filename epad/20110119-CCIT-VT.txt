DataONE Developer Call - 2011-01-19
===================================

:Attendees:


Agenda and Notes
----------------


1. Summary of EAB Meeting

Held Monday 17 - Tuesday 18 January

In summary: DataONE is well poised to address the general topics of data management at the NSF. The overall development approach seems good.

The presentations need significant refactoring. The entire presentation should be based on 2-4 user stories, walking the reviewers through how the functionality implemented by DataONE addresses problems or provides opportunity for users. Minimize technical details, but have technical slides prepared for specific topics if requested. 

Plan is to base the presentations on the science data lifecycle. The user stories cover portions of the lifecycle. 

- The audience will be a general mix - technical details in appendices

2. Review of Demonstration Targets for February Review

Science data lifecycle:
- Discovery, access, use and dissemination
- Interoperability, standards, and integration
- Explorations, visualization, and analysis
- Collection (acquisition)
- Deposition and ingest
- Curation and metadata management
- Protection (publish)


Demo 1. Search for interesting data (i.e. stuff that will be used in Demo 2).
- The search UI (i.e. mercury) needs to be working


Demo 2. The EVA demo. This involves an investigator downloading data from  DataONE into R and executing the scripts to generate a distribution map  (animation?). Bonus is to publish that back to a Member Node
- about 20sec to run
- single distribution generated
- need to science metadata describing the output

Demo 3. Basic process of a researcher adding content to a Member Node with some discovery 

- Add content to DataONE using client. Ideal = Morpho, minimum = CLI
(- Verify content available on Member Node)
- Content available on > 1 Member Node
- Content available in search index
- Add discovered content to Zotero

- emphasize that content is being pulled from multiple sources and metadata formats

Demo 4. 
- Perhaps turn off a member node and show that the content is still retrievable
