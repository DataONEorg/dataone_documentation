Attendees: Steve Ruggles, Tracy Kugler, Cathy Fitch, Bill Michener, Rebecca Koskela

Question about data objects - subsetting larger census data for the variables in which the user is interested
Relational database for metadata (SQLServer or mySQL); compressed ASCII flat files for
data - going to move to different storage system in future (column store)
GIS data is in postgres

Data in a large number of files is not a problem for DataONE (similar to the museum community)
If there are products that the community would be interested in, these might be a good start to
a MN

Data file integrated over time for a particular area - might be interesting to land-use community, human-environment interaction

Another possiblity would be to have metadata but necessarily with the data - just a link to
the web site 
This along with a derived data product that would be highly used would provide greater exposure for TerraPop

How difficult will it be to create the metadata?
Biggest use data will be small area data derived from the microdata - go to TerraPop for the microdata

Grand challenges in environmental questions include human impact data
Actually works in both directions

As prototype goes live, may be opportunities to make TerraPop more visible to new communites - for example, ESA (Ecological Society of America)

Issue of DataNet branding: develop a DataNet logo to put on all the DataNet web pages
Have a DataNet web site that links to all the DataNets

Summary:
 * Metadata repository that points to TerraPop
 * High value datasets that could be added to a repository
 * Joint DataNet web page
 * Millenial series at ESA where talk about grand challenges that could be served by data not usually accessed by the environmental community

Once prototype is complete, then will begin their (TerraPop) outreach activities

John Foley - head of Institute on the Environment at MN (global crop database)
175 crops and yield on acreage - global coverage from satellite data

DataONE: developing a 1 credit university course on managing research data and would be good to get some feedback on the curriculum
Margaret and Steve on panel on educating data curators 
Would be good to integrate data curation curriculum with the hands on data reformating for analysis
Symposium in Washington on educating people on curation - information science schools vs domain curation; most of the curation that is being done now is done by domain specialists not those with training in information science - report by the National Academy of Science

Education is an area where the DataNets could collaborate
DataONE: Best Practices Database (tied to data life cycle), Data Management Primer, Tools Database, Education Modules (all on web), 1 credit university course, 6 credit 3-week university course on data management

Thinking of a class on how to manipulate data in order to use it - 

Next Steps: 
TerraPop - take a look at the DataONE Architecture documentation and shorter document on how to become a MN
