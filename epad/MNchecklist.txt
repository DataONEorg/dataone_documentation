Attending: Rebecca, Dave, Amber, Laura, Matt, Chris, John

Rebecca: look at terminology re: testing, staging, since those things may mean something different to different audiences

We used to think that there would be more Metacat nodes, but in reality it looks like we are having more custom stacks.  Will a user know from our info if they are going to need a custom stack or not?  Decision in DEVELOP - if custom will need development test, if not can move to DEPLOY.

Chris: it would be nice to have a single online or printable document to go to as a prospective MN.

Need ONE document made publicly available on dataone.org MN webpage, high level with click-through to details on mule1

Also need detailed info internal to the project (all those details!)

Matt - have one detailed document, indicating what info is public/private 

ACTION:  Matt, Chris and Laura to work on merging the two documents, identify what is internal/external.  Then everyone review.  Plan is to have available by MNW mtg Friday 4/19/13.

PLAN
1 - MN expresses interest  --- determine feasibility
    see all those documents to review, INCLUDING partnership agreement, service level guidelines
2 - MN initiates process (was applies)  --- join the DataONE federation
 * obtaining a DataONE identity through docs.dataone.org gives redmine access to redmine, and allows the MN op to download their DataONE generated SSL certificates
3 - MN/DataONE collect MN info - an abbreviated version of MN desc doc, i.e. minimum information needed to proceed, to be entered in redmine  (LM-ensure we all know what info is required - a contact sheet - can be used to build the MN desc doc later)
4 - DataONE MN Wranglers evaluate proposal
5 - An agreement is reached (was approve/decline/defer) 
 * this is more of a concensus than an approval, although some edge cases will be a disapproval
6 - (was partnership agreement, service level guidelines --- move to DEPLOY-mutual acceptance)
7 - (was MN description document --- move to DEPLOY-register in production)
8 - Pre-implementation activities
    select the tier
    plan the implementation (metacat, custom stack, etc.??)

DEVELOP  (build=develop)
 - custom code required?  (see pre-implementation activities) - if you don't need custom code, go directly to DEPLOY
 * re-label this to be "Can use existing MN software?"
 - establish a test system

 - development iteration
 - development test

DEPLOY
Rebecca: we may need to re-word 'Register in staging', and 'Test in staging' - this term may not be familiar with potential Member Node operators
 - Register in staging  --- change to deploy in staging??
 - Test in staging
 - Register in production
    MN description document
 - Mutual acceptance - both parties agree to what was reviewed early on in the process

OPERATE
 - Announcement
 - Ongoing production operations
 - Participate in MN Forums
