Agenda for 2013-01-25 (11:00 MST - 11:30 MST)

1) CI Update (Vieglais)
Managed to resolve issues with access to virtual machines at UNM but Dave now has problems accessing UTK servers (know root causes and they are being dealt with). Version 1.1 in the final phase of testing and should be ready to release soon. Dave was at EVA WG meeting earlier this week. Good progress on tools that will be demonstrated at the RSV. Morpho should be ready. Discussion with Randy Butler and Jim Basney (?) - looking at original plan of security audit on DataONE is still viable. Will have plans in place about a security audit planned with CTSC by time of RSV.

2) MN Update (Cobb)
Working on the internal space on the docs site - will be there before the public web site
 * Workflow for process of adding new MN
 * Standing call for existing MNs (between 1 & 4 pm EST M-Th)
 * More interest from sites wanting to become MN

3) CEE Update (Budden)
Remind that quarterly newsletter goes at a beginning of March so needs content. CEE WG will be the WG that is highlighted. Material needs to be to Amber a week before the beginning of March (which coincides with the RSV). Carol and Amber have been attending a workshop at NCEAS on open publications. Survey from this workshop; preprint server - should be available for testing/UA in Summer. 


4) Around the room

Bruce: Visited with USA-NPN last week.  Worked through a few issues in the MN information form.  Right now, the next step is that USA-NPN needs to decide how they want to handle authentication (LDAP) for MetaCat.  This is something more broadly useful for USA-NPN, but could be used for just this MetaCat instance.  There are other things on the developer's plate that need to get done, so right now, we're probably looking at April for the next push on this MN.  And I've been down with the plague this week, so almost nothing else has gotten done.  

Dave: Discussion with Randy Butler also touched on interest by the various Illinois Surveys (Prarie Research Institute) (e.g. Natural History Survey, Geological Survey, Hydrological Survey) on how they can participate in DataONE, perhaps as a set of Member Nodes. NH Survey likely to be the first candidate according to Randy ("endangered data").  Also a brief discussion with Arctos as a potential member node - problem there is the relatedness of their content - which is really just a large relational database with many joins making it difficult to define what a "data record" actually is - at one extreme it is the specimen or observation record, at the other it is the entire database.  - So, we in USGS will have some similar issues (also GBIF) for what is a record for 108 (BISON)  - 300 million specimens...Potentially can define "Collection Level Metadata" that links back to individual occurences - we've done that at Species level before. Yep - perhaps the main challenge here is doing this in a way that makes sense from a reusability perspective. It's a common problem and a generic solution will be valuable.


Mike: Nothing to report this week. USGS Community for Data Integration Meeting is scheduled for May 20th Week in Denver. 
?? are you soliciting participation from dataone / etc? - Yes, I need to see about the Agenda and potential talks by DataONE participants...   ok - deborah mcguinness is interested - Ok, there is also Poster/Data Blast that I know virtually anyone will be able to participate in - which is actually a very cool session in the past. 


Steph: NCEAS developing CyberSEES proposal to focus on support of summer synthesis training and developing a virtual collaborative environment (due 5 Feb)

Deborah:
·        Progress on the Hydro-Eco Use case – writeup of some backend work was written up and submitted to Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI).  
·        Working on identifying provenance needs from some applications that go beyond the W3C prov proposal. 
·        Text Mining for Ontologies making progress.  Writeup below (mostly done by Stacy)

The Text Mining for Ontologies (TMO) project is a collaborative effort of the DataONE Semantics and Data Integration and Community Engagement and Education working groups and the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) project, and is focused on development of a semantic structure for earth and environmental science data. We are using a corpus of DataONE metadata records and a bottom-up statistical natural language processing approach (topic modeling) to both inform extension of existing ontologies and to leverage existing natural language metadata when formal annotation is unavailable or of low quality. We expect to deliver a prototype query interface that will illustrate an approach to supporting more thorough and efficient data discovery by ranking query results based on these richer semantic models and by providing users with topic model- and ontology-based suggestions for search refinement.
A early-stage search prototype is available at http://alchemist.nceas.ucsb.edu/tmosearch/demo.html (please be patient, it takes approximately 8 seconds for results to be returned). As the project progresses, we will continue to refine and integrate the retrieval algorithms and add features to the query interface, so check back to see new developments!
Key collaborators: Ben Adams (SONet postdoc), Deborah McGuinness (DataONE Semantics WG co-leader and SONet co-PI), Stacy Rebich Hespanha (DataONE CEE postdoc), Mark Schildhauer (DataONE Semantics WG member and SONet co-PI), Patrice Seyed (DataONE Semantics postdoc)
Comment: (Bill Michener) This is EXACTLY the type of thing to highlight at the Reverse Site visit
 
 John K: reference to his email re: DataCite
 CDL had a question from ResearchHub at UC Berkeley about if/when DataONE would support metadata for domains beyond the Earth sciences. This idea would appeal to ResearchHub's user base, and is consistent with CDL's need to be domain agnostic with our UC users.

In particular, the question came up about supporting the DataCite metadata schema.  This would introduce the possibility of seeing any research domain's datasets in DataONE, including economics, social science, astronomy, etc.  Would this be a good thing?  A bad thing?

Consensus was that this is a good thing

Working Group: Data Integration and Semantics 
Co-chairs: Deborah McGuinness and Jeff Horsburgh
Date: January 25, 2013   

Overall Objective: 
The mission of the Integration and Semantics Working Group is to guide the specification, adoption, and implementation of semantics technologies, broadly defined, which will enable DataONE to sustainably achieve its objectives for the seamless discovery, integration, and dissemination of Earth observational data.

Milestones for next 12 months: 
Future work for this project includes:
- Work with Dave Vieglas (CCIT) for testing the performance of search with and without the additional knowledge structures we are developing.
- Additional future work includes leveraging DataONE’s metadata environment, for example accessing eBird metadata and data through DataONE mechanisms, when available.
- Update a set of tasks and a mentorship plan for the Post-Doctoral scholar, Patrice Seyed, to correspond with the goals and objectives of the working group.  The initial task is focused on leveraging one or more of the semantic tools and infrastructure at RPI on DataOne data.  
- Examine the DataONE ONEDrive protototype and provide recommendations for how semantics could be used to improve the organizational/folder structure.
- Continue to develop and refine use cases to drive our work.  Our initial interdisciplinary use case leverages expertise from group members around hydrology and ecology.  It is available at: https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/integration-and-semantics/products/use-cases/Data-Integration-and-Semantics-Working-Group-HydroEco-Use-Case-Draft.docx/view.  This use case also has been created to demonstrate the need for and show how semantic technologies can enhance data discovery and integration.
- Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) group working toward specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data.  Work has begun on this effort including discussions among members Seyed, Schildhauer, McGuinness and SONet and DataONE member from SBC LTER O'Brien and the new SONet postdoc.
- Face to face meetings will include a meeting at the 2013 all hands meeting as well as one other meeting to be planned. 
- Co-Run a workshop for NSFabout research challenges and opportunities for knowledge representation.  McGuinness and Noy are 2 of the 3 co-chairs.  This workshop will take emerging science problems, including dataOne tasks to help motivate next generation needs for knowledge representation .  Workshop is in Arlington in early February 2013.


Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
- Patrice Seyed (postdoctoral fellow) has been leading the development of  the Hydro-Eco use case infrastructure and supporting ontologies, which now supports multi-domain environment quality data (water, air), exploring and visualizing species data (i.e., bird data from eBird, fish data from SBC-LTER) simultaneously with environment data, and dynamic hierarchical faceted exploration of chemicals (e.g., Arsenic) and species (e.g., Rock Eagle Owl) for enhanced searching capabilities.  It has also benefited from some involvement from McGuinness’ students in her semantic eScience class this term, thereby providing outreach to additional students as well as gaining the benefits of additional labor on, for example, some additional data identification and conversion.
- Patrice has been developing hierarchical knowledge structures by extracting/modularizing community ontologies for improving search that currently is performed by matching the approximately 10k terms in the Apache SOLR index.
- Suppawong Tuarob, DataONE Summer intern from Penn State, worked remotely under the collective mentorship of Line Pouchard, Jeff Horsburgh, Natasha Noy, and Giri Palanisamy to identify, implement, and evaluate automated text extraction techniques to enrich the metadata for ONEMercury.  His work examined how discovery of data might be improved through the DataONE ONEMercury data discovery client through the use of semantic technologies.  He examined initial sets of metadata from the ORNL DAAC, KNB, and Dryad.

Working Group: Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis
Co-chairs: Steve Kelling & Bob Cook
Date:  January 25, 2013  

Overall Objective: 
The scope of this EVA Working Group is to assist in the development of model analysis, visualization, and benchmarking cyberinfrastructure for output from terrestrial biosphere models.  The visualization and analysis will be done using the most appropriate tools (agnostic), but significant work has been done with UV-CDAT (http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/) and VisTrails (http://www.vistrails.org/).  These two tools will be used to  integrate data from diverse streams (model output and observational; implement benchmarks for land model performance, with a focus on carbon cycle, ecosystem, surface energy, and hydrological processes; apply the benchmarks to global models used as part of the MsTMIP (http://nacp.ornl.gov/MsTMIP.shtml ) and TRENDY model data intercomparison (http://dgvm.ceh.ac.uk/trendy-gcp); strengthen linkages between experimental, monitoring, remote sensing, and climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and new measurement programs.   Benchmarking of models will be doing by integrating disparate types of observational data and model output in conjunction with ILAMB (http://ilamb.org/). DataONE will benefit from an understanding of how scientists are interested in acquiring, integrating, processing, visualizing and evaluating complex data, as well as from examples of the cyberinfrastructure used to conduct these EVA activities.

 
Milestones for next 12 months: 
·       N.B.:  Additional Milestones will be derived from the EVA Working Group meeting, which was held on January 22-23, 2013 (see Accomplishments below)
·       February 2013:
o   Demonstrate a solution for the integration of DataONE Cyber-infrastructure, EVA scientific workflows, and provenance tools.
·       Summer 2013:
o   Summer intern program to implement a pilot prototype of Provenance-aware Model Exploration, Evaluation, and Benchmarking Cyber-infrastructure (joint with Provenance / Workflow Working Group).
·       November 2013:  
o   Fourth EVA-ILAMB Working Group Meeting:  Demonstrate functionality for model intercomparison and benchmarking, seek feedback, and plan for next design phase.
·       February 2014:
o   Fourth EVA-ILAMB Working Group Meeting: Incorporate additional benchmarking functionality into Ultra-visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools, seek user input, and plan for next design phase.
 
Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
·       January 22-23, 2013:
o   EVA Working Group meeting held at NYU-Poly in Brooklyn, NY.  A number of activities and other actions were discussed and planned, the details of which will be fleshed out in the coming months.  For the following activities, leads and participants were identified: 
1.     Pilot Prototyping of "Provenance-aware Model Exploration, Evaluation, and Benchmarking Cyber-infrastructure" (Joint with EVA and Provenance WGs)
2.     Machine learning to develop new visualization methods for model evaluations
3.     Usability Assessment of visualization techniques for climate community experts (survey and paper) 
4.     Visualization for multi-dimensional scaling (both metric and non-metric).  Longer term activity (proposal)
5.     Evaluation of visualization needs of policy makers (defer for 12 months)
 
·       August, 2012 – January, 2013:
o   Yaxing Wei, a joint Provenance WG and EVA WG member,  developed an example VisTrails-based climate model-data comparison workflows to demonstrate a solution for the integration of DataONE Cyber-infrastructure, EVA scientific workflows, and provenance tools. This example demonstrates that (1) data resources from DataONE repositories can be discovered and accessed from inside VisTrails workflows, (2) output results along with their associated workflows and provenance can be published and preserved in DataONE repository, and (3) the provenance information can be searched and retrieved from DataONE repository into provenance tools for further customization and data products reproduction.
·       November 27, 2012:
o   Held a teleconference to demonstrate functionality for data integration and analysis, and visualization built into Ultra-visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools UV-CDAT and to plan next EVA Working Group Meeting.
·       August – December 2012:  
o   DataONE EVA interacting with EarthCube Brokering Concept Group.  Bob Cook and Yaxing Wei (joint EVA and Provenance WG Member) are sharing a DataONE use case (Carbon and Climate Modeling) and data from the NASA MsTMIP project as an example for the Brokering Concept Group.  We have held a number of teleconferences with the Group, including their IT component at the National Research Council of Italy, and have started to use brokering services to access and process carbon model output.
·       November 2012:  
o   Aritra Dasgupta was selected as a post-doc for the DataONE Exploration, Visualization, Analysis Working Group.  Aritra, who completed his degree in 2012 in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Visualization and Visual Analytics at UNC-Charlotte, will be located with Claudio Silva at NYU-Poly, Brooklyn, New York.  Aritra’s work will be to assist in adding functionality to Ultra-visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) for model analysis, visualization, and benchmarking for model intercomparison.
·       June – August 2012:
o   ORNL Summer Intern Jorge Poco, a grad student from NYU funded by other projects, begins work to add benchmarking and model intercomparison capability to (UV-CDAT).  UV-CDAT is a community tool being developed by staff at ORNL, NYU, and other institutions with DOE funding.  A key aspect of this work is examining the uncertainty associated with re-gridding spatial data into a common projection / grid for intercomparison.
