    DFC wants to be able to compare functionality
    
Interop opportunity: A tier 1 implementation of irods under DataOne
    Also an opp to do the other way round:  A dataOne node under iRODS federation
   Make an irods based grid a DataOne node using the generic member node (python based, InCommon authentication, LDAP server)
   iPlant as a possibility(DataONE contact there is Damian Gessler, DFC contact is Nirav Merchant)
   Provide a soft link from iRODS to DataONE resources through Tier 1 read interface

Ken Casey at NOAA Oceanographics data center.
CLASS in use now, its architect thinks it should just be storage.
NCDC contact, alan hall, has presnted the inside-outside firewall architecture to other NOAA data centers.

NASA contacts:  

TO DO  MCW--send copy of DFC collaboration proposal to DataOne

NASA - DataONE working with people in Washington, DC in addition to the ORNL DAAC

Other issues related to collaboration:
Jane Greenberg student - now sufficient money for 2 students (one sponsored by DFC and one by DataONE)

TODO for Rebecca: Communicate with Jane Greenberg      re: student(s) copy everyone on email

Original intent for DataNets - focus on all the communities/domains supported by NSF
Not sure this has happened as proposals have been awarded; Sylvia Spengler had emphasized computer science research but now the emphasis has been on implementation

iRODS is interested in the publication challenge - policy issues related to publication (by this means making data available to the public)

A similar challenge is the issue of streaming data - how to deal with that
DFC: for OOI does the packaging of discrete packages of streaming data
DataONE working with their partners to have discrete snapshots of the streaming data to
facilitate reproducibilty of science

Parallel I/O streams for large datasets

XSEDE - DFC: Chris Jordan - DataONE- John Cobb (ORNL)

Community Engagement: 
DFC: Engineering digital library - doesn't start until next year
DataONE: museums, K12 education - providing datasets

Integration of social media tools with the infrastructure (iPlant has done this)
VIVO: http://vivoweb.org/
This work  (VIVO)  is funded by the National Institutes of Health, U24 RR029822. 

MetaCat and Mercury are in Java--MetaCat is tier 4 and Mercury is tier 1 implementation
