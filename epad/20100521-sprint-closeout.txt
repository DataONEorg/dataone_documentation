Sprint Closeout and Startup - 2010-05-21
========================================

:Who: Dave, Chad, Roger, Robert



Good,  Bad, Ugly
----------------

- burndown actually points down
- Dave - very limited time to work on sprint
- Metacat is in great shape - CRUD interface looking good
- Roger - needs to close out tasks during the sprint
  - tasks better aligned with actual work
- Integration testing still needs to be done for 0.3!



New tasks / stories
-------------------

Need to setup a "cn-service" account in LDAP for metacat administration

#620 - next sprint (S6)

#269 - move to S6

#288 - move to S6

#262 is a high priority for completion
#268 - S6 ?

#591, #420, #421 

- New task to pull data from a KNB / metacat instance and generate sysmeta as part of the unit test process rather than generating fake metadata / data.

#586, 587, 596, 588 - hopefully close out during meeting next week. Otherwise S6

#593, #594 - need to have tasks assigned, perhaps 2hrs left (about 8hrs so far)

Need to add a story for integration of the metadata packager into JMS (3)

Roger
