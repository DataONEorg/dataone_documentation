**Initial Agenda**

 * Review the Agenda for Day One and Day Two
   * Add/remove agenda items

 * Drive the ontology development by annotating many datasets
   * Annotating metadata fields
     * Most common attributes in knb: Year, date, plot, species, site
 * Develop design patterns for ontology class development


 * Review and discuss syntactic changes to OBOE
   * Modular files approach
     * **oboe-core**
     * **oboe-characteristics**
     * **oboe-standards**
     * oboe-spatial
     * oboe-temporal
     * oboe-taxa
     * oboe-chemistry
     * oboe-anatomy

   * Spatial class additions (GML 3.2.1 entities)
     * Use WCS ontology schema from iri.columbia.edu?

   * Temporal class additions (GML 3.2.1 entities)
     * Use WCS ontology schema from iri.columbia.edu?

   * Taxanomic classes (Top level taxonomic rank classes)
     * Ranks as classes vs. ranks as individual members of Rank?
     * Other models?

   * Anatomical class additions (portions of CARO & TAO)
     * Fully incorporate CARO?

   * Authoritative definitions of terms
   * Domain-agnostic URI? (purl.org?)
   * Resolvable class definitions

 * Discuss part/whole relationship approaches
   * Has been an impediment to class development (need a solution)
     ENVO (environment ontology) RO (relationship ontology)
     Mark: RO is missing several notions of partonomy relationships
   * Discuss OBOE Relationship class
   * Discuss SBC implementation of hasPart/partOf wrt:
   * Varzi, Winston et al. concepts recommended by Mark

     * parts as individual units (cognitively salient parts, e.g. ships in a fleet)
       * individualMemberOf
       * hasIndividualMember

     * parts as portion of a whole (dependent on the interaction as a whole, e.g. the left side, slice of pie)
       * Self-connected 'parts'
       * hasPortion ??
       * portionOf ??

     * material constitution (e.g. iron is part of steel)
       * materialPortionOf
       * hasMaterialPortion
       * consituentOf
       * hasConstituent

     * mixture composition (same as parts as individual units?)

     * conceptual inclusion (domain and range are parts of a model)

     * functional components 

 * How to define protocols
   * restrictions on entities/characteristics?
   * Ask Ben

 * Annotations (Day 2?)
   * Morpho+semtools download: http://bespin.nceas.ucsb.edu/downloads/semtools/


NOTES: 

 * Morpho/tool enhancement
   * individuals in the ontology should show up in the browser (GermanyCreek instance of Site)
   * metadata (values) as observations ("floating context")
   * primitive values vs. class/instance values in annotation syntax (value as static attribute of measurement or as a nested element of measurement)
     * this also applies to attribute mapping syntax, where a value can be used here as well too
     * in general need to deal with primitive value (entities) and non-primitive value entities (individuals/classes) 
   * add map conditions (e.g., if="species eq 'WCH'" value="jmx:Chinook") to annotation interface
     * need to include in search and materialization
   * need to add object-property range entity search in discovery tools
     * e.g., CohoPopulation = Population and consistsOf only Coho
     * other examples SmellingSalts made up of Amonium, or Hydrogen in Water
     * searching for Coho would then match a dataset with observations of CohoPopulation
   * need to support context in measurement types in morpho annotation editor
     * e.g., ConcentrationOfAmmoniumInFreshWater, the InFreshWater is "lost" when an attribute tied to the measurement type
     * the context observation can "float"
     * an attribute could be tied to a measurement of the context observation
     * multiple attributes could have the same context observation


 * discussed oboe model w.r.t. entity, characteristic, value (entity) 
 * discussed using individuals, e.g.:
      observation:
         entity: "jmx:GermanyCreek"
      versus
      observation:
         entity: "oboe:Location"
         characteristic: "oboe:Name"
         value: "Germany Creek"
   * Note that above, we could also add an Id characteristic
      observation: 
         entity: "oboe:Location"
         characteristic: "oboe:Id"
         value: "jmx:GermanyCreek"
 * went through example JMX datasets to identify measurements (13 datasets):
   * date (month, day, year)
   * species (code, e.g., WCH)
   * week #
   * fork length
   * weight
   * k factor (condition index)
   * location (creek)
   * age
   * card #
   * pos #
   * origin (wild, hatchery, etc.)
   * trap type (screw trap, etc.)
   * life stage
   * trap set date (day, mo, yr, time)
   * trap pulled date (day, mo, yr, time)
   * counts (the main data collected)
     * count of live smolt, dead smolt, lamperey w/eyes, w/out eyes, by fish species, etc.
   * staff guage (height of creek)
   * debris (in river)
   * secchi (water clarity of river)
 * discussed possible JMX use case: 
   * Excel to CSV to basic EML (automated)
     * Requires some conventions on Excel like one table per sheet, one cell per attribute name, unique attribute names (Ok to have tables in "long" or "wide" form -- pivoted/unpivoted)
   * Semantic annotation of attributes via pre-defined template / measurement types / value mappings
   * Ability to select datasets, materialize to rdf triples, and execute data subsetting query (e.g., via SPARQL) ... e.g., for a specific year, location, species, 
   * Feed this subsetted data into model/data flow used by JMX (i.e., Mara [sp?])
 * another more ambituous JMX use case: 
   * create a general routine to map from JMX observational data to the JMX/EPA uber schema
   * this would help automate the conversion from ad-hoc spreadsheets to the uber schema (e.g., to make it easier for tribes)

   * AliveOrganism
   * DeadOrganism
   * FishStageOrganism
     * SmoltStageOrganism
     * YearlyStageOrganism


Mark: A characteristic can also be modeled as a measurement type 
 * e.g., temperate can be broken down to a measurement of kinetic energy in the molecules of the entity being measured (e.g., air, water, etc.) 
 * another example would be productivity, which has "surrogate" measures

OBOE organization, files

core model:
oboe-core.owl
All modules and/or extensions should import this file.

OBOE:
oboe.owl
imports of oboe-core and all domain modules only
does not have any extensions.

Domain modules:
oboe-[domain].owl
By building modules specific to scientific domains, (eg, oceanography, chemistry, hydrology), we can engage experts in those domains as needed.  

OBOE Extensions:
oboe-sbclter.owl  
extensions import oboe-core, and whatever domain modules they need. Extenstions are allowed to pull from any of the modules and make assertions between them.
