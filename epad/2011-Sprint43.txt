Nick
 * Updated d1_libclient_java's MNode with systemMetadataChanged implementation
 * Updated d1_common_java's Constants to have a RESOURCE_META_CHANGED string to build POST url to MN
 * suggested changing systemMetadataChange's method signature to systemMetadataChanged(Session, Identifier) to allow a simpler POST /dirtyMeta/{pid} call on the MN more in line with other api functions instead of including pid, dateSysMetaLastModified, and serialVersion in the SimpleMultipartEntity for the call.
 * Will work with Chris on replication testing to update MN software

Chris
 * Updated d1_common code with serialVersion additions
 * added in serial version to replicaton calls and authorization calls in Metacat's CN stack
 * Finished CN resource handlers for CNReplication in Metacat
 * Updated d1_common API with systemMetadataChanged() method
 * Working on adding MN.systemMetadataChanged() in Metacat's MN stack
 * Will add a new knb.war file into cn-buildout for testing
 * Will work with Nick on replication testing

Roger
- Pretty much finished with MNStorage.systemMetadataChanged(), but have not fully tested it yet.
- Next item my list is to bring the command line client up to date.
- Will be following up on Tier 3 tests as Rob works with those.

Rob
- added jump page for the MNWebTester: http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080
- turned on Hudson, and set up a custom nodelist for figuring out which nodes to test.  Currently demo2 and gmn-dev.  Only running MNTier tests.
- new builds are failing with strange class loading error (only on MNWebTester) - fixed.
TODO:
- need to review MN and CN apis against the changelog, and propogate to libclient_java.
- new integration test for modifiedSystemMetadata()
- add svn revision to libclient and common java packages.
- decide on test user to use for testing restricted methods.

Skye
- Reading arch docs - use cases, api.
- TODO: Dev env. setup.
- TODO: List page for web tester to discover and list available tests running on server.

Robert
-Updated LDAP schema with new restriction structure
-Update Node registry component with new restriction structure
-Started creating client for updating restrictions (will use perl for personal use)
-Will update LDIF with sample method restriction for adding formats to format registry so Ben can have sample to use when needed
