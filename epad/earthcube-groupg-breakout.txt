Group G agreements on approach
--------------------------------------------------

1. Start with a collaboration MOU that identifies conceptual committement to a set of guiding principles
    -- need to be defined, start from existing like DataONE Partnership agreement, Amazon framework example
    -- principles like: commit to providing data through a particular set of web services

2. Create a federated set of resources that agree to community-shared web service interfaces
    -- e.g., DataONE web services, OGC web services, etc.
    
3. Ensure data resources have effective metadata for reuse and sharing

4. Ensure some set of models relevant to the problem have sufficient metadata to allow them to be used in a larger workflow
    -- e.g., service description for execution in wf engine
    -- e.g.,  wrapper for local execution in wf engine

5. Evaluate set of workflow engines that can be applied to the domain problem

6. Generate requirements for next stage of integrative science 
    -- e.g., new components, new engines, additional software needed
