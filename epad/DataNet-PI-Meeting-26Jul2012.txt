8:45 – 9:15 DataONE

9:15 – 9:45 DFC (Reagan Moore)
DataNet Federation Consortium - Data Driven Science (3 goals)
 * Implement national data structure
 * Enable collaborative infrastructure
 * (missed this one)

OOI, National Climatic Data Center
CUAHSI, UNC Institute for the Environment, National Climatic Data Center
CIBER-U (Drexel University - Engineering digital library)

Community-based Collection Life Cycle rather than the Data Life Cycle

Suggesting re-use of architecture components for EarthCube

Tools:
 * iRODS data grid (policy-based data management; brokering technology; 50 different clients; operations based on name spaces (users,objects,collections,state information, resources,policies,procedures))
 * Soft links - register data from external data management system, access it
 * Federated data grids
 * Workflow integration

9:45 – 10:00 Break

10:00 – 10:30 SEAD (Margaret Hedstrom)

Sustainability Science/Research - multi-discipline
 * Actionable Data
 * Active and Social Curation

Next steps:
 * Bulk ingest of NCED data (1.5TB) to Active Content Repository (ACR) (Jul-Aug)
 * Add profiles to SEAD VIVO for all NCED researchers (Jul-Aug)
 * Build out ACR with new data types
   * IRBO, Mississippi River flooding survey, ACRR repository
   * Engage early in new project (WCS-MRBO)
 * ACR User interface and testing
 * Pass selected data sets/collections from ACR to Institutional Repositories/ICPRS, other DataNets

SEAD Interoperability with OAIS-Compliant Repositories
 * synchronization interface (at input)
 * publication interface (before moving into institutional repositories)

10:30 – 11:00 TerraPop (Steve Ruggles)

Terra Populus (Integrated Data on Population and Environment)
Focus is on integration - data with different formats from different scientific domains easily interoperable
 * Archival Development - starting with population microdata (Brazil and Malawi - IPUMS)
   * Microdata started in 1964 in the US; started adding international data in 2000
   * Combining with environmental data - Global Land Cover 2000, Global Landscapes Initiative, WorldClim -> Microdata + Area-level data + Raster data
   * Importance of Metadata and Preservation
 * Dissemination and Analysis
   * High-speed microdata aggregation
   * Visualization: maps and graphs
   * API will allow others to develop additional analysis capabilities

 * Education and Outreach
   * Fathom (educational s/w), Science on a Sphere (museum program)
 * Organization Development including Sustainability


11:00 – 11:30 Q & A

TerraPop - allows users to create datasets and download them
DFC - providing infrastructure so setup own environment
SEAD - wide set of ambitions/capabilities - letting community drive this; researcher has data that wants preserved - puts in drop box and is geo-referenced and shows up on map (not clear how this will happen once deposited in dropbox)
DataONE- through individual MNs; discover data from other MNS; also discover data through search portal; educational resources from web site; interaction with other tools, such as DMPTool; DataUP, also point to other DataNets

Decision on when to publish datasets?
Up to the indvidual rearchers - DM plan now encourages researchers to think about preservation and access to data
Observatory networks making decisions on when to make data available - continuous streams of data from OOI and NEON
Also curation problem if extremely large dataset
To SEAD there is not an obvious publication point - publication may be triggered by an event (publication of a paper), process (community decides)

Are community practices changing?
Dryad accepts data same time as article submitted for publication - reviewers can see the data and metadata as well as the submitted paper - 60 journals on board now with more in the queue
SEAD: Publishing of data along with paper raises some issues - data doesn't necessarily have long term value (technology changing so fast; may be only a slice of larger amount of data) - advantages reproducibility of science but only addresses a small part of the "data" problem

Data with privacy implications?
Yes

11:30 – 12:30 Lunch, Background on RCN (Bill Michener)
12:30 – 1:15 Develop RCN proposal outline, writing assignments

Round-Robin Pairwise Collaborations (conference phone available)

Friday, July 27
MPC Meeting Room – 29 Willey Hall

8:45 – 10:30 Large Group Discussion - DataNet Program: The Big Picture
Brief characterizations of each project, especially as they relate to overall program
 * Report out on pairwise discussions
 * How projects complement each other
 * Projects’ roles within overall program
 * Potential for DataNet-wide collaborations
Goal: Draft extended outline & introduction to DataNet vision document/RCN proposal

Link to the google doc: http://bit.ly/N1J17J on items to include in RCN proposal

10:30 – 11:00 Break
11:00 – 12:00 Wrap-up, next steps

Questions for Bob Chadduck

 * DN relationship with other NSF Initiatives
 * News on DWF/DAITF/etc
 * Collaboration/vision document for DNs (e.g. individual, coordinated)
   * format
   * content
 * Interoperability requirements for DNs (meetings, plans, RCN, etc)
