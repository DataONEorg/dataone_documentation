14 September 2011
Day 2 S&G WG Meeting, Oak Ridge, TN

CI Products Ready at Public Release (December 2011)
 * 3 Coordinating Nodes (CNs)
   * synchronization,indexing of content (metadata), replication, identity management, monitoring, logging (logs are aggregated by all CNs)
   * tightly coupled with CNs is the search interface ("the thing to be named")
   * user interface for identity management probably won't be done at public release
   * logging in is a challenge - authenticating against CILogin is challenging - redirected to home institution; download certificate to install on your machine; working on a proxy to download the certificate for you but not sure this will work with the search interface at this point
 * Dryad, DACC, KNB, Merritt, USGS BioClearinghouse,Matt's list of Metacat-based MNs, 1 or more Mercury-based Member Nodes (MNs) (6-9 MNs)
   * 4-tiers of MNs
     * 1 - public access (Mercury-based MNs) DAAC, USGS
     * 2- support for access control; public & private content - possibly Dryad
     * 3-enables content to be written using DataONE API
     * 4- bit-level preservation (acts as replication target) - KNB and possibly Merritt
   * Generic MN (supports Tier 4) - not currently being used at any MN but used along with CN
   * Compute MNs in prototype phase - probably not ready for public release
 * Investigator Toolkit (ITK)
   * "the thing to be named" search interface
   * For MN developers:
     * libraries and documentation
     * command line tool
   * R plug-in
     * Given identifier for data package, can download data directly into R
   * DataONE drive
     * Treats services in DataONE as a network drive - have support for Linux, Mac, & Windows
   * Zotero and Mendley citation generator
   * all tools will be read-only at public release
