Agenda: 

NOTE:  New meeting time at least through the end of July - 2:30p Eastern

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest
        
        FOLLOW-UP -- DUG activities/outcomes:

   * MPC Progress - still working on getting DC information to Tracy et al.  BEW: need to resolve the container question and propose specific fields that should be mapped to the indexing.  IN PROGRESS
     * Need for Fall review. No developer access in Sept. They need some clarification [sorry lost phrase??? -jwc] concerning Dublin core components. They are starting with GMN implementation.  Plan to have Roger Dahl as a CCIT POC
     * Dave: the other side of the DC issue will need discussion with MPC. Probably involve Skye as well.  Dave to look at an initial Schema (based on OAI_PMH) for DC.  Bruce to look at initial mapping of DC elements to DataONE index.   

   * DUG  discussion re: increased MN involvement with DataONE - distribution list to Rebecca 8/1/14  - when is a good time to get this out to the field?  Action: document still needs to be cleaned, but not clear which edits are to be accepted.  Bruce to work with Laura to get a finalized version of this document ready for Bill to send out.  Target sending this out after PEP is completed.  Defer action on this until end of August and revisit this in terms of available cycles. Put this as an action at LT for AHM if it hasn't been dealt with before then.  
     * 

        1.5   Current MNs
                 Dryad listObjects issue, see https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/6010 
                    Robert queried a particular date range but results returned records out  of bounds; Robert has talked with Ryan and he is aware of the issue and  will address next week; potential for impact in synchronization if  dates are being interpreted incorrectly (doesn't look like a time zone  issue - conversation with BEW and LM yesterday)  <<<<< At MNF yesterday, Ryan said it is related to Dryad dropping the time stamp, so the date stamp gets out of whack.  He has assigned a developer to it on their end.  No Wrangler actions needed.
                   
                    LTER transitioning from metacat instance to PASTA GMN; In process.  No Wrangler actions needed.
                
        2. Status of upcoming MNs
     
     * Y5Q4 (awaiting input from MNs to determine a more realistic schedule)
       * USCarolina (3689) - awaiting response
       * IARC (4700) - Jim came to the MNF yesterday; he's got quite a bit of the work done on his end and is looking at next steps - i.e. webtester, working in sandbox/stage, etc.  Laura to set up conversations with Jim, Mark, Roger to ensure Jim has what he needs to move forward. (BEW add to tracker)

     * Y6Q1
       * ORNL MNs (RGD (4248) and EDORA (4247)) - meeting 8/7/14; Chris/Ranjeet et al. working to resolve last issues related to FGDC, etc.
       * MPC (3708) - continuing conversations with Tracy/Wendy; Bruce sent DC "wrapper" info to Tracy, Wendy responded with questions; it's getting there
       * DFC (3532) - Lisa doing development and running WebTester.  Next step - get DFC in development environment.  Bruce ping Chris and Lisa on status.
       * UIC (3213)  - they're  having a project prioritization meeting next week, will have  a better  idea of schedule for next 3 months after that (completion  required by 31  Oct).
       * PPBio (3748) - MNDD/logo submitted, Listed on public website as upcoming
       * NKN (3238)   - at MNF yesterday, Ed said they were able to use their "old" certs from the previous ubuntu MN (new is redhat); plan to have NKN in prod by 31 Oct.

     * Y6Q2
       * GBIF (4730)  - development  paused while GBIF does their annual planning; thinking  about working  with Atlas of Living Australia (VERY early discussions).  Discuss the MoC request from GBIF.  Mark, Laura, and Rebecca to work on this MOU/MoC.  Tim R out on vacation until 8/18.  Rebecca now has access to draft of letter.
       * Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (4296) - will know more after their visit to the states; Rebecca and Mark to talk about who can talk to the SN folks when they're in Albuquerque
       * GLEON (3422) -  Nothing new.  passed the MNDD template on to Corinna - she will pick up when she gets back in August
       * Montana State University Institute on Ecosystems (IoE) (3687) - Seth said they are having some unrelated IT commotion, so we're on hold.

     * Y6Q3
       * SAEON (3205) - Chris or Mark will be able to help Alex at SAEON.

    Future
       * TERN-Australia - Rebecca and Bruce working on wording of MOU - On hold for MOU until PEP is complete. Might have Allison at AHM.
       * FigShare - Bruce is POC
       * NODC - revisit, target for next 18mos (Bruce/Matt) - Bruce to talk with Ken Casey


        3. Old action items
              MN Documentation - MN Deployment and MN Ongoing Operations - Laura to do  this  -- working on identifying needs and best methods to address those  needs, including ask.dataone.org, documentation in mule1 or on  dataone.org, etc.

             
        4. Not-high profile issues
        
            Process for end-of-implemention (when/how to indicate a MN is "upcoming" on the dashboard, etc.) - Laura and Amber - we had previously decided that when a MN goes into stage testing, it is appropriate to show them as an upcoming MN.  However, in redmine we don't currenty have a status indicating what stage a MN is working in.  We have a "testing" status, so we had thought we'd use that - when a MN changes status to "testing", we can show it as upcoming.  We still need to explicitly define the process and who does what when, and try it out on the next MN(s) in the queue.
            Amber: maybe list them on web as "upcoming" when we go to staging -- but we need a redmine state to show that staging has started.  Dave to look and see if can notify Amber and Laura (and Bruce?) when there are changes to the stage and production node lists. Need a redmine state to show that staging has started.
            
            (Was under Current MNs related to SANParks, CDL, etc.)
            LT  to address Memorandum of Understanding (re: operations and service expectations) between DataONE and MNs  -  is there anything I (LM) can be doing to move this along, draft something up, pull out the work previously done, etc.?? (Rebecca, Mark, & Laura have been tasked with this and will begin work week of 8/11)

       
        5. Around the room

Discussed the idea of whether to move this back to 2:00 ET.  Consensus was that we should go ahead and leave this as a 2:30 ET meeting (1:30 CT, 12:30 MT, 11:30 PT), to allow for a break between the LT call and this          


Tickler (things to revisit periodically)

Purpose of MN Description Document (past and future) 
     Intent is to describe the (potential) MN, identify the  types/quantity/formats of data they hold, - perhaps we need a   "friendlier" format, perhaps an interview process;
     Workflow: should this information (MNDD) be collected at the beginning  of the process, or is the way we've been doing it lately (after the  fact) a new way of doing business??  Also consider if  this information  gathering (form or interview) is the best use of resources for those  potential MNs who may or may not become a MN if implemented as a first  step.  Possibly change the workflow? Is a pdf the best way to view the  information?
    Next steps:  Laura to come up with alternative(s) to current MNDD - content is good, but format/mechanism needs some work.  
    Another thing: Laura and Amber to look at workflow for last stages of implementation, test with EDAC  too late for that, need to pick another one.
    Also -- how does the MN DD relate to: 
                    the node document:  https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/node  - developers have/create this information (node registration, see updateNodeCapabilities)
                    and redmine??    <--- work with redmine as mostly-authoritative source
     Could a spreadsheet be a viable solution?  Maybe.  A database would  work.  In any case, some information is appropriately "private" -  how   would we handle that?
                

Revisit the default "only results with data"  checkbox to unchecked; plan is to move the   checkbox from search page  to results page but remain checked by default, initial draft in  development environment.
               
Bob's feedback about the dashboard - he suggested a count of MNs on the dashboard (MNs, RNs), probably/maybe an easy thing to do a count of MNs and RNs and display
