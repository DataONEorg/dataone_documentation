DataONE Animations Discussion
Paul Allen and Bob Sandusky
August 18, 2010

General goals for animations
 * Animations should be understandable by anyone interested in DataONE: domain scientists, administrators, NSF program officers, librarians, social scientists, computer scientists
   * avoid information overload or excessive technical detail
 * Animations should be short: less than 3 minutes long
 * Animations should have narration and be captioned
 * Animations should be consistent with the technical implementation
 * Animations should express what is implemented, what is to be implemented in a future milestone, and be clearly labeled as to what version of the DataONE architecture they represent

Process
1. select a process to represent or a question to address
2. storyboard the animation
3. review with CCIT
4. revise and vet
5. produce animation using a visually talented person

Ideas for key questions/processes to be documented
 * What does it mean for my respotitory to become a member node?
   * What do I have to implement?
   * What additional services can I then offer my clientele?
 * Scientist  point of view (data producer)
   * three types of scientists
     * already associated with a MN
     * already associated with a data repository/network 
     * scientist, unaffliated with any data repository/network
   * Where does my data go?
     * How is my data replicated? (split off into separate technical detail)
     * Preservation
   * Where does my metadata go?
     * What metadata does D1 support?
   * Data usage reporting
   * Other value added
     * data access control (future)
 * How does D1 benefit scienctists in domain X? (data consumer)
   * Discovery 
     * How do scientists locate data
   * Retrieval
   * data integration (future capability)
   * Investigator Toolkit Integration
 * What happens when a member node fails or is dismantled?
 * Core D1 operations - Coordinating Nodes
   * services offered
     * search
     * preservation (oversee replication of data)
   * syncrhonication of metadata
   * 
 * Future Roadmap
