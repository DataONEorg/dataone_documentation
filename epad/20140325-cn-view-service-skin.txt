20140325 - DataONE Coordinating Node View Service
=================================================

Attendees
---------

Dave Vieglais, Isis Serna, Chris Allen, Chris Jones

Goal 
----

Provide a service on the coordinating nodes that given an identifier (PID), will provide a rendering of the content associated with the PID suitable for viewing in a web browser. 

This "content view by identifier" capability is available already in Metacat, which operates as a core component of the Coordinating Node software stack. Enabling access to the Metcat view service at a standard URL should functionality required by such a service.

The appearance of the Metacat view service can be "skinned" to alter the look and feel of the rendering. 

Example of a metacat view of identifer: "doi:10.5063/F10V89RP"
