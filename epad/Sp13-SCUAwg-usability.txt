BEGIN CURRENT MEETING EPAD

04.30.2013

Present:
Mike Frame, Priyanki Sinha, Rob Olendorf, Rachael Hu, Rob Christensen, Bruce Grant, Roger Dahl, Dave Vieglais, Mary Beth West

Roger Dahl provided walk through of the ONEDrive
-There are three different prototypes

First prototyped system's layout --> Standalone application --> 
@ to symbolize Filter, alphabetized filters; application of filters -- not hierarchically necessarily

Advantages & Disadvantages - 
https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/itk/d1_client_onedrive/doc/build/html/mockups/standalone/index.html

Mike asked if when you access the mounted drive, could a dialogue box be provided to filter and access data

Rachael asked if member nodes are aware of the filtering that the DataONE uses; might be helpful for there to be a feedback loop to let them know what types of fields DataONE uses to help with their findability within the DataONE systems (i.e., if you - the member node- don't use keywords in your records, users will not be able to see their records if they filter by keyword)

Second prototyped system --> ONEMercury Integration --> 
https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/itk/d1_client_onedrive/doc/build/html/mockups/onemercury-integration/index.html

Bruce suggested a "Check" box next to each record to help with selection of records to open in ONEDrive

Third prototyped system --> O.S. specific integration --> 
https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/itk/d1_client_onedrive/doc/build/html/mockups/native-integration/index.html

There may be a need to have an assessment to question what kinds of users would be using this tool (e.g., use cases):
-What kinds of operating systems?
-What kinds of data uses and needs?
-Notification of new items: Read me on new items or like Dropbox pop up "X # of new items" - or some functionality similar to RSS or populating to RSS

Technical question
-Would spotlight search be an option? Unknown at present, OS specific
-Hierarchies may not be as simple as it looks if there were many options for a hierarchical option (e.g., Author lists), if the list was long how would it work or simplify finding of the records

Semantics working group is working on streamlining the metadata or discussing the best ways of doing so, this would greatly help with this system and other systems

We should focus on what is possible now for this development and then look toward investing a lot of time in finding the best ways for determining adoption, clientele, etc.

Questions on the potential of data citation and how to find/cite the data set and its found location

Where to we go/paths to take?
-What should Version 1 include as features or integration?
-Look at the 3 major aspects - 
1. Folder hierarchy and representation
2. User entering restrictions
3. How to present the content that's in the tree (data packages, meta documents, etc.) - representaitons of content
-Look at both platforms, but Windows should probably be first priority
-Do we want to design from the start to the web as a product, too (e.g., logging in - cross-pollinating to develop a tool) - Will people log in, what kinds of problems would that present for authenticating, etc.
-Who is the type of audience for using this tool?
-How often would they use this tool?
-Use of the solar index?  Will that be changing in the foreseeable future? No, but should we continue to thinking about it, etc.
-Will this be a developed in the 5 years?
    -Need to consider resources and time for developing this; implementation effort into each of these; should be considered in Release 1 and not limit us down the road
    
-What features do we want to see in Release 1? Read-only, etc.
-What would be attractive to the end-users?

Sketch it out tomorrow

Geographical search: Allow for polar coordinates.

ONEMercury mockup:
- add checkboxes for search results, to select which one to add to folders

05.01.2013 Notes

Reviewed previous ONEDriveFeedback document
https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/usability-and-assessment/meetings-usability-and-assessments-working-group/ahm-oct-2011/ci-tools-evaluation-notes/AHM10182011ONEDriveFeedback-latest.txt/view?searchterm=onedrive


Features:

General Features/Concept of operations:


0. DataONE Workspace will be created for logged in users

Before Workspace create, potentially create an xml configuration file that can be downloaded from Search for ONEDrive "filtering/configuration"

1. ONEDrive will be accessed via ONEMercury

2. Go directly to ONEDrive from Desktop - ie. mounting network File Share
   Configuration file for ONEDrive - pre-configured Searches/Filters - i.e ONEMercury 
   Bookmarking feature. (feature of the online workspace rather than a feature of ONEDrive)

3. Read only capability - will not be able to write back to DataONE
4. ability to drag a folder (data package, all data associated with a keyword, etc.) into other investigator tools - tool/os dependant capability 
5. Support user annotations on content - shared user space - quality, rating, comprehensioin, comments capability done at ONEMercury/DataONE Level - ONEDrive then inherit this "content".  Tied to online Workspace environment. Need for workflow back to the provider of the dataset - Community Engaging Activity (ACTION - Do an environmental scan of effective models (FUTURE)
6. Login - online workspace will be accessed via Login method - Potentially just use E-mail address to keep up with users configurations (Will require TERMS of Service Disclaimer) 
7. statistics should be segregated by the tool/interface that generated them -- this way we can sort out the stats for ONEDrive from other tools (via User Agent Header) 
8. Ability to share work space and/or folder with other users (right click, properties, share) - property of Workspace
9. Data USE/Privacy statements needs to be developed and added to ONEMercury/DataONE.org
10. Maintain backward compatability
11. Member nodes may also want to integrate their UIs with the workspace environment. So, workspace API needs to be defined 

File System View - hierarchy presentation

1. improve listing of keywords, using controlled vocabularies or separating into pages

2. Use CDL Namaste tags for enhancing the directory listing? (generalize to support controlled vocabularies / hierarchies for categorizing content)
https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/Namaste

3. when opening a file, report the canonical path, rather than the path used to locate the item (this will allow applications to cache a path that should be stable)

Package Structure - Data Packages

1. generate more features like abstract.txt automatically from the metadata, investigate other output formats that people would want
1b. take the metadata and format it for as a new data set, perhaps for only particular users.

2. multi-language support -- generate multi-language abstracts

User Subseting/Query to define content
1. separate filtering from access -- use mercury as the recommended way to search, then allow the results to be opened in a filesystem view (e.g., a "smart folder") (+3)
   * allow filtering on geography (+1)

2. shopping cart for single/multiple replication to ONEDrive

3. bookmark lists / persistence 

4. ability to find data similar to existing data, or collaborative filtering

5. allow the filter query to be updated on the fly (while the drive is mounted)

Additional Features:




Workflow for Browser Based UI Interaction

Use Case 1.  A user is browsing for content related to some topic, and is cherry picking interesting content for more detailed local investigation.

1. User queries Web Interface to find content

2. User clicks on "Save" for a package

   [[ Option to "Select All" content, or cherry pick, on search results page ]]
   [[ Option to set page size to a much larger value, 200+ ]]

3. Selected packages are saved to virtual workspace in "My Packages" or some user defined folder

4. User select option to retrieve content from WS: zip, email, ONEDrive, ...

5. ONEDrive option selected: 

6. ONEDrive connection is made

7. ONEDrive retrieves list of package identifiers of content in workspace

8. Packages are available on the users ONEDrive mount point


Use Case 2. A user has a specific query that defines content they'd like to see in ONEDrive. The search results should be dynamic and show new results as they are added to DataONE. 

1. User queries Web interface to find content

2. User clicks on "Save Query"

3. Query is saved to user's workspace with optional user specified name for folder

4. User selects option to download content

5. ONEDRive selected

6. ONEDrive connection is made

7. ONEDrive creates a mount point using the query that the user saved.

8. Content is available on ONEDrive and may be used locally

- What is the notification for new content being available? RSS feed? Email?

Data Package Representation

Reviewed mockup

Suggestions:

-Distinguish between rendered version versus the raw/original version

-Package level metadata (ex. ReadME file, owners, etc.)
 - README should include a citation for the content (official representation, in a format that can be imported into other apps like mendeley, zotero, etc)

-Show some level of detail in the WorkSpace
    *File view/Directory view in the user interface

-Name of folder is associated with the identifier with the files as file name (may not be attractive as file name) - may be useful to create folder names on the fly; the ability to click on the file name and rename, supporting renaming from lookup table (adjusting value)
    *Rename button or "add your own" or annotation that could appear in a "readme file"
    
-Note, when someone drags a folder from ONEDrive to their local computer, all of the data will be downloaded, too, which could be fine, but the user should know that and make that choice

Member Node issue: Generating Display Names/Choosing Display Names
    *Add place holder in DataONE systems, prepopulate that field with some version of the identifier with the appropriate semantics for file system
    
Suggestion for Display Name: get it from the "citation" entry in the OneMercury search interface --> the First line in grey --> "Author, Start Date, Title". We noted some issues with some of this text (e.g. some citations begin with a "."), but this can be solved by a process of "Graceful Evolution" (AB) down the road.
    
Potential Question for UI Testing: Ask users about whether they care about "Display Name" --> what would be most meaningful (e.g., Author, YR, Institution)

Package repesentation in OneDrive...for the presentation having a large number of files for the user --> Right now we don't have a lot of content in data packages, one of the member nodes that is coming online soon has run into this issue was overwhelming, our suggestion was to make it hierarchical  
    *ORE would represent each package as it's own identifier and point to another data pacakage, so when you go to download the whole thing you have your options

Issues: 
1. Number of object in a package (e.g. 100k)
- Create subfolders? (e.g. group by characters in name)
- Don't deal with it? Give up. Provide feedback to user that there's more stuff
- Use a hierarchy of packages (currently recommended procedure)
- Display the first n entries

2. Size of objects in a package
- Depends a lot on the file system browser (e.g. preview in OSX Finder)
- Content is not retrieved until opened (so generally not a problem)
- ONEDrive should impose some practical limits to the size of objects that are retrieved automatically
- Could perhaps create a link for very large files that provides a third party mechanism for download (e.g. open in browser)

3. Standard representations of packages:
- show an expanded bagit view in the file system for a package
- other standard options for showing packages of data?

4. File Names of objects
- for packages, the author, date, title line looks useful
- for other files, the identifier may work
- Need to have something of a lookup table in ONEDrive that provides the mapping between local display name and the object identifier

Recommendations for UI Testing
-DUG Potential/Carry over into ESIP
-Have users/potential users walk through screenshots and discuss the system (expectations, etc.)
-Could add questions about "what they wanted in terms of managing files"
 *  Potential Question for UI Testing: Ask users about whether they care about "Display Name" --> what would be most meaningful (e.g., Author, YR, Institution)

File System Hierarchy

Do we want to make it recursive, so once you've defined a facet (e.g., Keyword) it wouldn't have the addional facets repeating themselves (e.g., EndDate, MemberNode, etc.)?  --> Making the file flat and start listing all the results (i.e., Click "Keyword" filter and list all keywords)
    -Is it useful? Is it behaving how you would expect or want it to?
    -Could you group the filters? Make a "Further Refine" folder
    
-Looked at 5.1 Mockups again
    Problem with the representation to be consistent with mapping -- guidance with metadata to these controlled terms
    
-This could be phased: Focus on author or high-level buckets of facets as first view then roll out taxa and regions

-Initially show just "Authors" from index; grouping facets drawn from index fields

-All could then later be facets in ONEMercury and could help with organization

Reviewed all of the fields that are available of the records (e.g., metadata and perhaps picking for initial choices for indexing in the hierarchy)

Field name: "topic" could be useful for mapping via standard ontology

NEED TO LOOK/DISCUSS WITH OTHER GROUPS RE: NORMALIZATION (at least tackle for the short term -- truncation of plurals and capitalization, etc.)
