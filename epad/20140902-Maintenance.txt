Release Management Procedures
    To help streamline forward planning of releases:
    Release backlog - issues that are complete but not released and how to schedule next release features. Release Backlog is a 'Target Version'
    'Target version' has traditionally been our Sprint Blocks.
    Look into enabling "releases" feature in backlogs http://www.redminebacklogs.net/topics/releases.html
    Open up redmine for administrative tasks.  
        milestone
    'Product Version' is open text field - allows new product versions to be added ad hoc (Should we consider this the CCI Release Version (Major + Minor + Patch), or the version number of the software product to be released. What is the product version of data corrections?)
    'Milestones' have been CCI Major + Minor release goals, or other significant goals to reach.
    Action: Mark will work with Dave to schedule a meeting to discuss above (target sometime week of 9/8)
