 *  Questions
   * First set (due today for submission to NSF) -sent


   * Second set (need drafts completed by Tues, Nov 19th so can be submitted to NSF on Nov 22)

   * 1.     [Lead: Koskela Contributors: _Wilson,Allard,__Trisha,_______ ] What critical challenges does DataONE see in the next five years and what are the contingency plans to mitigate those risks? 


   * 2.    [Lead: Vieglais Contributors:  Jones  ] How does DataONE plan to manage Member Node <-> Coordinating Node and Coordinating Node <-> Coordinating Node network bandwidth requirements?

   * 3.     [Lead: _Wilson_______    Contributors: _Vieglais_______    ] How will technology evolutions contribute to the proposed “slender node” developments?

   * 4.  [Lead: Wilson Contributors:_Vieglais__________   ]   {on  cybersecurity - 10b in original set of questions} draft complete

   * 5.    [Lead: Budden   Contributors: _Suzie,_Viv___trisha______   ]  What is DataONE’s strategy for community engagement in the context of global science interests “over and above” expectations typically associated with education, training and outreach?  What are DataONE’s plans for outreach to science educators and students?

   * 6.     [Lead: Michener Contributors:  Vieglais, Jones, Bertram, Deborah] Please present specific DataONE accomplishments in the first five years of efforts as the basis to understand and assess opportunities for DataONE future evolution and technical expansion.

Approximate Schedule 
 * Mid February - Application period opens 
 * Mid March - Deadline for receipt of applications 
 * Early April - Notification of acceptance 
 * Late May - Program begins*

 *  Collaboration Meeting 1st week of March (from deborah - i think virtual participation will be possible)
 *  Extra funding
   *  OPENDAP as a Member Node
   *  DSpace as a Member Node
   * Reworking the search interface
   * Enabling the workspace environment (saving searches in user space)
   * Additional Member Node stacks (Slender Node (may not be concrete enough yet), OAI-PMH)
   * Distribute Metacat and GMN as virtual machines
   * Reworking the authentication environment (again, not well defined)
   * Finish off ONEDrive and other tools (may make more sense to have own developers do this)
   * Effort into website design
   * Science writer for promotional materials


3.  Around the Room
          
John Cobb: Will meet next week with Carol Song, PI of recently awarded DIBBS, "Integrating Geospatial Capabilities into HUBzero" with the goal of (re)establishing a DataONE integrattion project with her DIBB's effort. Comments and guidance from LT solicitated.
 * My basic idea was to explore adding DataONE SPI to the HubZero SW package. This would make it possible for HUB* installations to have DataONE integrable archive collections and to add a Toolkit connection to the HubZero Rappture rapid application development environment.
 * Dave V: let me get back to Cobb with some possible ideas

Carol: Last week I presented the keynote talk at the Electronic Resources and Consortia Meeting at National Taiwan University in Taipei.  My talk was "Research Data Services: A new focus for libraries" and someone from our Taiwan member node was there in addition to academic librarians and publishers from around Taiwan and some from Hong Kong.
The kick-off meeting for BCube (EarthCube Brokering) was this week in Port Angeles, WA. I attended a bit virtually, but not enough to report on it yet. I believe I'm the only DataONE person left on it.  Stacy Rebich Hespanha from UCSB is also on BCube.

Bob:  Nothing to report this week.

Amber: ESA propsals due next week.  Working on a DMP special session (as in previous years) and a Ignite style showcase of tools and best practices.  Suggestions welcomed for speakers willing to present as part of the latter.  This is being coordinated with NEON and we are also collaborating on a science communication Ignite session.  Again, speaker suggestions welcome.  
Member Node news items were not released this week due to the current CN issue even though there are new MNs in production.   (Hopefully) there will be a lot of communications going out next week. 

Viv: Nothing this week.

Bill:  ?, ?, and more ?s; Next S&G mtg duirng March 31 thru April 11--tbd.  In San Francisco.

Bertram: nothing new.

Deborah: nothing new
