Coordination Meeting for DataONE, TeraGrid MN, STEM TeraGrid Analyses

This meeting is to provide a status update of progress since the last meeting, detailed at http://epad.dataone.org/20110429-D1-TG-STEM

Attendees: Matt Jones, Daniel Fink, Kevin Webb, Dave Vieglais, Nick Dexter, Theo          Damoulas, John Cobb


Agenda
 * review of target dates:
   * July 15 - STEM analysis products being deposited dynamically, as analyses are complete
   * discuss and resolve any blockers at CCIT meeting in July; add check up call to CCIT agenda
 * status report on action items from previous meeting:
   * (Kevin  - lead, Daniel, Matt, Paul, Vivek): [June 30] come up with real  metadata template for STEM results; use Matt's first draft created for  the Feb NSF demo
   * (Daniel  - lead, Dave, Nick, Kevin): [May 31] Draft a document describing  information flow and major components, systems, services and protocols  involved in the interactions
   * (Matt  - lead, Kevin, Dave?, Paul, Nick): [June 15; needs draft of document  above] Review the R package design and refactor as necessary for  supporting this experiment
     * Evaluate whether STEM analysis would use R package at all; might be commandline instead
     * Design packaging/ folder structures etc for pushing content back into D1. Relationships between content elements.
     * 
     * How many file
     * 600 files for each fold for a single species
     * About 200 files per sepcies per year
     * For an entire species about 1000 files per species
     * Species count 200-400 species.
     * per fold takes ~ 3 hours. across 100 cores
     * across fold summary is ~ 1 hour more 
     * Q: What is the network connectivity between Lonestar output storage adn the Tg-D1 node. It is currently 1 gbs today andwill move to 10 gbs this summer
     * note: today lonestar is predicting about a 6 hour queue wait for a 5 hour 100 node job (https://portal.teragrid.org/group/tg-portal/hpc-queue-prediction)
     * Q: What is the average file size (uncompressed, and compressed)?
     * 
   * (Dave):[June 15] Design and implement setup staging implementation of D1 infrastructure
   * (Paul): schedule regular (monthly) checkin of this group
     * June - first/second week
     * July - during CCIT meeting
     * August - TBD
 * new issues to solve?
 * new action items?
   * Mount filesystem for intermediate data transfer (Nick)
   * Goal for July CCIT meeting: get all development scripts working to create EML and upload data and metadata to dataone development nodes (Kevin, Daniel, Matt)
   * Production runs will start in beginning of July -- try to get EML generation finished by the time these runs start so that we have what needs to be archived later
   * June 30 - Quick Follow-up meeting before CCIT conference

Notes:

Cobb:
Update: Progress on DataONE Member node implementation on TG and  mounting filesystems - Perhaps Nick can brief in my abscence

AI: (cobb) Create a sicence gateway for this effort and associate it with the active allocation.

Note: TeraGrid is undergoing transition form TeraGrid to "XSEDE" as the programmatic successor. Hopefully not too much will change

Issue: planning the flwo from computation to depostition into D1 and transport to CLO . This is probably a topic to discuss.
