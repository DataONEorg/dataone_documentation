Agenda for 2012-01-20
 
1.     CI Status (Vieglais)
Setting up release candidates for the release software and verifying the code content - then will be moved into the released state. Should happen quickly because are passing the integration tests; Process from here: setting up sandbox environment to test production-scale system. Expect sandbox to be fully functional early next week and then can evaluate the services that will be released. Many interactions among components but this will be tested in the sandbox environment. 
MN: metacat in very good position - close to release ready; GMN passing tests; Mercury and Dryad unchanged
Status of MercuryONE: dependent on SOLR index and it's pretty complete; final testing of interface still needs some attention; this is one of the things that will be tested in the sandbox

2.   Website (Budden)
Nearing completion with the exception of the Data tab - no content there yet.
Find and Contribute are intended to link to MercuryONE
No material from CI Working Groups either

Will need to do a public release planning meeting

3.  Summer Internships  (Budden/Koskela)
     - Team: Amber, Rebecca, Bruce, and Todd
     - Projects
     - Projects requested by interns?
 Funding for 8 internships this summer 
 Concern with opening up process to interns suggesting projects may result in too many applications and time involved to review would be too much
 Have projects that need to move forward so perhaps this is something we can evaluate again in the future
 Not much support for this at this point;
 CCIT will submit some; Mike thinking of one and Suzie & Carol don't think they will have
 one    
     
4.  Opportunities to use end of INTEROP funds (Michener/Koskela)
Bill has approximately $50K  left in Participant Costs that could easily support a couple workshops  (e.g., education best practices and/or learning modules; a follow-up data governance workshop; etc.).  The problem is we need to spend by June 30th.  Any ideas or priorities from you all?  To spend $, we can include stipends as appropriate.

2 Options proposed so far:
 * follow-up data governance workshop
 * follow-up to education modules for the web (Steph: Stacy may be interested in helping to organize)
 * summer internships
 * interaction with tribal college / workshop on data management

5.  Quarterly Report Time - need papers/presentations/workshops/etc by January 27th

6. Updated charters/ members of Working Groups (will be sent by email)/  (Koskela)

Changes to U&A WG charter were approved by Executive Team; new charter can be
