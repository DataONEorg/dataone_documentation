Software for more indepth (time consuming) animations

http://www.daz3d.com/products/daz-studio/daz-studio-what-is-daz-studio/ -- seems usable, basic version is free, characters seem to cost extra
http://www.creatoon.com/-- CreaToonÂ® is a powerful software solution for the PC to create 2D animation in the cut-out style, no further tech support or development, PC only, free, seems to be older technology.

Examples of other types of videos other than xtranormal
http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/8086a40dbf/the-day-the-data-diedloose-bruce-kerr-parody-of-don-mcleans-american-pie-from-bkerr3 - funny, easy to create, somewhat relavant, 4 mins long
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJPSOWJjWqo - not very exciting but demonstrates "white board" animation style, 4 mins long
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uzUh1VT98 - "Librarians do Gaga", entertaining, 4 mins, demonstrates easy to make type of video with real people set to music with new words, not specific to data management, some people may not love it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-dcelODFL0- 1 min advertisement for "Informatica", simple video format, not that exciting but demonstrates another video type, not sure if we want to include product advertisements as examples? Missed the ad part at the end.  I think we have enough other to delete this. - SW

Ideas for stories
Alternatively, a movie could be about how good data management could change plot lines in contemporary classics.  See http://www.information-management.com/photo_gallery/1_18/Fargo_data_management_fraud_ROI10020859-1.html for examples ...  web site with scenarios, perhaps a resource for ideas about videos but not a resource for making videos, etc.
