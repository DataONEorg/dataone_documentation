Goals for 2.2 release

Overall release goal: improvements in Kepler for specific science users

Who are we targeting:
1) Pedagogical: target core curriculum in some specific domain
2) People who would benefit from 'choose and wire' paradigm
3) Java programmer: who wants to extend and specialize Kepler

Potential feature improvements
A. Improve workflow publishing system for scientists
   -- populate with workflows from our projects
   -- evaluate myExperiment workflows for inclusion in Kepler
   -- what improvements are needed?
   
B. Finishing and polishing the provenance framework
  -- integrate comad-style prov with other prov
  -- add in provenance browser support -- data dependency browser
  -- integrate with run manager
  
C. Publish standard models or analyses as workflows that act as exemplars
  -- pedagogical tool
  -- follow one or more textbooks, becomes tool for instruction
  -- our development team isn't the right group to pick these, need domain advice
  -- important to decide how to position Kepler (e.g., dataflow workflows, versus analytical modeling, etc)
  
D. Make R a first-class component in Kepler

E. Improvements to UI of displaying hierarchical models
    -- e.g., easy way to expand composites
    
F. Build component library that is needed to satisfy particular community needs
    -- e.g., full suite of stats analysis actors

G. Make it easier to transform and shim data to pass to external tools wrapped in Kepler

Assessment of top priority
Top choice
Ilkay - A, then B
Mark - C
Tim - A, then B
Matt - F
Christopher - A, then C
Shawn - A, but need C to populate, need F for C

TODO
* Schedule K/C developers telecon for 2.1 release for Fri 16th (Ilkay will arrange)
* Matt will integrate this list onto plone page for K/C priorities
* Matt send synopsis of call to Bertram
* Aug 4 call -- develop ideas for 2.2 further
