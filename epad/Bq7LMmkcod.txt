** Provenance WG Meeting**  Wednesday 

Overall Theme & Goals:
- alignment of the WG efforts to the DataONE objectives and technical architecture
- refine existing/define new use cases (e.g. collaborative workflow provenance) 

Block 1:
* Update on Data-Tree-of-Life (DToL) Summer Project
-- includes DToL use case: collaborate provenance (https://sites.google.com/site/datatolproject/)
* Overview  of provenance models/capabilities of workflow systems
-- lightning talks: 10min each: Kepler, Pegasus, Taverna, Vistrails

Block 2:  
* Discuss DataONE-related use cases, starting from DToL/collab. provenance (see above)
* How to provenance-enable the DataONE architecture, and why (towards an architecture for DataONE + Provenance Infrastructure)

Block 3+4:
Detailed planning of next WG activities  (in view of reporting to the plenary session on Thu)




Wednesday, 2010-10-03
---------------------

:Block 1: (two streams)

A) Investigator Toolkit. Applications to be targeted (esp. for February
   review). Web interface UI design.

B) Data modeling and packaging. 

   Outcome: plan for mapping between or working with data packaging in the
   DataONE architecture.


:Block 2: (two streams)

A) Working with embedded identifiers

B) Data Citation


:Block 3: (two streams)

A) Authentication technology implementation

B) Project operations and administration. Web site, servers, doc management.


:Block 4:

A) Authorization and access control
  
* Technical implementation for scalability
* Access control rule compatibility across systems
* Consistency of role definition

B) ...

:BOF: Hardware budget planning

* Storage for high capacity member nodes
* CN computational and storage capacity
* Supporting infrastructure (network, backup, power)


Thursday, 2010-10-04
--------------------

:Block 1:

* Evaluate the existing working group structure, and reconfigure as necessary
  to align with major research topics / unknowns identified during previous
  two days. 

  Outcome: List of "mini" working groups, more tightly focussed than previous
  WG definitions.


:Block 2:

* Develop WG mini-charters from Block 1. Paragraph or so describing what needs
  to be done, deliverables, major milestones, participants. 

  Outcome: set of charters (at least late draft stage) for guiding WG
  activities and composition for next 12-36 months.


:Block 3:

* Revisiting schedule and detailed dev plans, tie in WG charters

* Calendaring for meetings


:Block 4:

* Closing, plenary. Summaries from meeting.


---------- 

Notes past here


* Implementing authentication, authorization, and identity management (two
  blocks), focus on prototype impl.  Focus on authorization implementation aspects.

* Integrating output from Bertram's group (two blocks)

  - reports from each technical working groups
  - helping other working groups getting started
  - synopsis from joint wg on semantics (Matt)

* Data modeling and packaging - how to map this into the DataONE data model or adapt / change DataONE to work with more granular models
of data collections

* General update on related topics / projects (perhaps over dinner)

* Investigator Toolkit.  Need to invest time in developing some nicer tools for compelling demonstrations (esp for Feb target)
  - define roadmap for prioritizing apps / tools for integration

* User interface for data discovery, search and delivery
  - semantic search topics 

* (related to delivery above) Integration / working nicely with existing systems.  For example EML URLs point to some data set - how to take those URLS and make them
behave as identifiers in the DataONE context
