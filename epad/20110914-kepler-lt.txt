Notes
--------
0. Pre-meeting discussion; Galaxy WF system; focus on particular domain, nto a general purpose system
1. Workshop: Bertram: Need NSF approval for NCE; use PSC for a little salary shortfall; but mainly use PSC for a Kepler organiational meeting; goals: advertise what Kepler acheived, create momentum; basic tutorials targeting domain scientists
    Why: inspire community contributions; bring together Kepler community; affect broader outreach into domain sciences (beyond the Kepler programming community); hold as workshop with papers; should also have posters, tutorials, other ways of participating; 
    Which communities:
        -- Domain scientists
            -- Ecology, metagenomics, 
        -- Projects: Fusion community, CAMERA
        -- Technical contributors
    What activities:
        -- tutorials
        -- application papers
