DUG Business Meeting
Jul 15 2012

Expanding the Membership

If expanding to scientists - need to have webinars (not techie talks) with use cases to sell DataONE and the DUG.  Need to get the community to express their 'wants' to really engage them.  

Build up and market the expectations of DUG next year.  If you have scientists coming, need a separate track for them.

Lack of engagement of scientists attributable to CI still in development.  Now is the time to start engaging these people.  Replicate what SAS & ESRI do to get feedback on what to do next to make users happier.

What about the development group?  What can the DUG do for developers.

Students should be on the list but what does the DUG offer the the student?  Potential for it to give the students a leg up.  Such as??  Ideas - hack-a-thon (sponsored by Microsoft?), help develop their skill base in data management preservation etc., have students do webinars, networking opportunities for the students, 

What does it mean to be a member?
There is a danger of lowering the barrier too low (experience of NEON)
Need to articulate membership benefits - beta testing group, benefit to us and them.
Need to have this coversation with S&G bc there are implicaitons for 501c3 status.

Special Interest Groups?
Librarian community - Bob sent out an email to assess interest

How do we keep the voice of the DUG in DataONE decision making?  Sub group interaction on an adhoc basis?

Meeting locations
Pairing with a major conference is important.
ESIP bring connections with potential MNs etc
ESA would bring in more users
AGU is broader but possibly too big?
Some meetings are too long to have people come and engage for an extra couple of days.

Decouple annual meeting from having 'DataONE' presence at other meetings.  Have a 'DUG' meet-up / activities at disciplinary meetings?
