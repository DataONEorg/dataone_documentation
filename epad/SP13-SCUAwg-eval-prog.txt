1.       Assess changing ecosystem ….

a.       Periodic (say once every two years) meetings to assess and update DataONE vision for the next 10 years.

b.      Obtain and evaluate metrics to compare with other similar organizations – ESIP federation (DataONE is a member, but also is somewhat similar in goals and structure)

2.       Identify evaluation stakeholders

a.       Clearly member nodes are stakeholders

b.      Potential member nodes

c.       Funding organizations – NSF now, but may be others in the future

d.      Scientific user community

3.       Evaluation design …

a.       Some of the metrics we have already developed are scalable

b.      Should focus on metrics that assess DataONE’s contributions; i.e., the incremental improvements resulting from MN’s being part of DataONE organizations (as opposed to going about their business independently) – we had defined such metrics in some of our earlier meetings

4.       Identify who should help conduct/assess evaluation

a.       Automated metrics collection – DataONE CI group

b.      Development of surveys – UA WG

c.       Independent (external organization) could be hired to conduct and evaluate surveys (e.g., EOSDIS uses CFI for the annual American Consumer Satisfaction Index survey; questions are provided by NASA and the DAACs, but actual conduct of the survey and analysis of results is done by CFI – see http://cfigroup.com/about_cfi/acsi)

d.      Internal evaluations by MN’s as well as DataONE team

5.       Assess evaluating data

a.       Not sure what this really means. Are we talking about assessing how data being evaluated?
