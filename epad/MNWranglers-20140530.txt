Attending:  Laura, John, Bruce, Amber, Dave

Regrets:  Rebecca

Agenda: 

New meeting time at least through the end of July - 2:30p Eastern

Laura and Amber to talk prior to next MNF re: who's presenting at the DUG 

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest)
        
                CN fix (tidy process)?   At yesterday's MNF, Dave said tidy is done and things seem to be operating normally.  
                
                MN Dashboard  (Drupal team = Chris Allen or Isis)
                        The dashboard is in production and we have a news item ready to release, but there have been some difficulties with load time and incomplete loads. 
                        We (Bruce, John, Laura) tried pulling up the dataone.org site, and the dashboard, with varying results using Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari
                        Dave will put in a ticket for this

(Hold off on this until everyone present)
                Purpose of MN Description Document (past and future) - past: identify data holdings (type, volume, etc.), operations, to aid in MN development.  future: ???  
                
        1.5   Current MNs
                 CDL's synchronization is still turned off - Laura to ask Chris about CDL's current status
                
        2. Status of upcoming MNs
    
     * Y5Q4
       * LTER-Europe  (3232) - News item approved; Laura/Amber to coordinate move to production/announcement  - Whoops!  issues with no resource maps, Chris assisting
       * EDAC (3221) -  Soren says EDAC is ready to go; email in to Rob inquiring actual status (flurry of activity before AHM); Laura/Amber to coordinate move to production/announcement.  Have a note in to Rob inquiring as to current status.  Last we spoke, harvesting has begun and he was doing those final checks.
       * DFC (3532) -  Bruce has corresponded with Lisa; following up
       * MPC (3708) - registering in sandbox - Laura needs to touch base.
       * ORNL MNs (RGD (4248) and EDORA (4247)) - moved to "testing", MNDDs/logo for EDORA and RGD received from Bob; Jim is registering both in staging; in meeting 5/29/14, 
       * GLEON (3422) - Corinna was at the MNF yesterday; she's coming to the DUG; it may take some selling to convince other folks involved with GLEON management that it's a good thing to participate with DataONE (was DataONE participation a deliverable on their contract?)
       * PPBio (3748) -  After moving their server to LNCC, they have decided to revert to the original location in Manaus.  When this is accomplished, we expect to move quickly.
       * NKN (3238) - Ed was at the MNF yesterday; working right along
       * SAEON (3205) - Chris is working with Alex to find a time when they can upgrade their metacat

    Future
       * TERN Australia (4286): Met with Alison/Amber at AHM to work on education/outreach items (draft MOU scope item C);  some changes in funding down under.    
         * Hope to meet with Nikki Thurgate when she's in the states, perhaps around DUG; working on scope items A and B in particular, meeting again in June.
       * IARC   (International Arctic Research Center) (4700) - Jim, Mike, Tim and Laura met this week to discuss GeoNetwork questions; Jim to start serious development week of 6/2/14
       * EU BON -- Looking to deploy a test MN (probably Sierra Nevada) in the next 6-9 months. 

        3. Old action items
             MN Documentation - MN Deployment and MN Ongoing Operations - holding
             
        4. Not-high profile issues
     * Redmine ticket generator - plan to apply to IARC and GBIF
       
        5. Around the room
            Dave:  re: EDAC, registered in production, issue with their server response time, timing out in some cases, discussion scheduled Monday to figure out what's going on
                        Ran a load impact test: 
http://loadimpact.com/load-test/www.dataone.org-a252eb65d9c769a361cd4ed449151ebd
                        showing an avg load time of >20 secs, definitely something going on
            Amber:  MN Showcase at DUG, there are funds to support travel/accommodations support available
                        Laura to send email to current MNs individually, noting that support is available if needed
            John:  nothing today not already mentioned
