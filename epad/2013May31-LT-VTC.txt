Agenda for 2013-05-31

1) CI Update (Vieglais)

Nothing major to report - going through some scheduling work for the development activities for the next few months. There has been a minor issue with the docs site but Nick has been working on that. Was down 5/30/2013 - there have been issues with the Plone site having spikes in memory usage. Short-term work around is to restart server. If you notice the docs site down, please contact - Nick Brand or Matt (or anyone on CCIT).
Dave is looking at updating the redmine site - no date set but should just be a brief outage.

SEAD and TFRI in testing environment right now - technically things look good for both to
move forward. Matt added that policy is holding SEAD up right now so discussion is ongoing.
Dryad is ready to be added to a testing envirnoment, waiting on Ryan to complete the registration in the testing environment - hopefully next week.

Ongoing discussions on immutability as well as data packages with extremely large number of files. 

2) CEE Update  (Budden)
Amber has been working on DUG details. Working with Laura on the MN showcase and Andrew on roundtables. Currently have 40 registrations and 10 posters - need to cut off the
posters at 12 due to space limitation.
Collating bios on possible CEE WG members. The DataONE Summer Internships have started and the notebook site for the interns is ready:

https://notebooks.dataone.org/

Another change in the notebook site is a blog aggregation site:
