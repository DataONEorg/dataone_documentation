Participants: Anand, Biva, Saumen, Paolo, Bertram, Daniel Zinn

* Report from Anand:
1) Querying the Kepler native provenance information from my code using query API(some bugs in it, trying to debug)
2)Learned the RDF syntaxes(how they differ from core XML specification)
3)Tried to generate the RDF specification from the native provenance OPM format(tried to debug the concerned utility.)
   Also  got acquainted with the tools which can generate a graphical/ 3 tuple representation of the data from a plain RDF file.
4)Analyzing the questions which can be asked against  SPS(more of that coming up shortly)

* Report from Biva:
Using ProvenanceAPI to query provenance database(mysql) in Taverna 
Step 1: install eclipse
Step 2: install maven http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/
Step 3: install maven pluggin in eclipse and link in with the maven installed using setting.xml file
Step 4: download the svn checkout from http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/provenance/Taverna_provenance_howto
Step 5: Update dependencies
Step 6: do maven clean install
Step 7: run src/main/java net.sf.taverna.t2.provenance.api.client.ProvenanceAPISamleClient.java
 
NOTES: there are two querry files: minimal.xml and completeGraph.xml which can be tried and the resource file is APIClient.properties.
ERRORS ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTION:
        1) 'repositories.repository.id' must be unique: it was a problem with the latest version of maven pluggin of eclipse thst requires the   repositary id to be unique. It was solved by making the ids unique.
        2)bundle not found error: the resource was not in the src/main/resource directory. was solved by bringing the resource to the correct directory
        3) minor errors: minor errors like unable to connect to the database can be caused by leading and trailing spaces in the name and password used to connect to the database.
RESOURCES
  http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/provenance/ProvenanceQueryLanguage
PS: I have also tried a simple query of my own to understand the xml database schema:

* Report from Saumen:
- Developed the conceptual schema
- Installed COMAD and ran FPC1, FPC2, and FPC3
- Installed ProvenanceBrowser with MySQL and loaded the FPC1.trace into the database.
- Read opm1.01 paper
- Read papers on comad
==> some problems with provenance browser / MySQL

Q: IPAW paper -- read??

* Paolo going over Concrete Target Scenario:

==> Someone to do the equivalent of Paolo's A.2 ("publishing" data to the shared data store SDS) for Kepler

Taverna2public mapping
is naturally in RDF using OWL:same-as statements

When ready to publish the data of a previously run workflow,
a "publication workflow" is executed whose products include the mapping table.

==> A2.3 students!!

Bob picks up Y data (ignoring issues of discovery, metadata)
possibly massaging it into Y'.
Need to assert explictely Y-->[Bob-preparation]-->Y'






* NEXT ACTIONS
==> Bertram, Paolo ==> google wave for DToL (or IRC channel)
--> "Good Morning DToL!"

==> Bertram publish the CM
==> Manish, Saumen et al to create relational schema

==> Deliverables page: just an *index* (create your own pages for your deliverables, products!)

==> A2.3 students!!
