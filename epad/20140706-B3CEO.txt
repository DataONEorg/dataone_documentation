Webinar discussion:

Topics
Need to consider audience - different webinars for different audiences
 * Using the DataONE discovery tools (librarians may want this in a different flavor)
 * How to work with data - sharing / uploading / best practices
 * Tutorials for tools in the ITK (overview and also specifics)
 * Tools 101; community tools for all different areas of the DLC
 * What it is to be a MN; tiers, process etc
 * Consider what DataONE strengths have been and focus on those.  Data description needed in the community
 * Convert educaiton modules into webinars
 * How to configure metacat as a MN (topics of interest to the IT community)
 * Sustainable software, reproducibility
 * Open data - example of how they worked with DataONE
 * Data Integration and analysis
 * What every grad student needs to know about ... (base of BPs)
 * How to engage your community with DataONE
 * Data papers / data publication

Have webinar 'tracks' for different types of users
Topic based approached - otherwise tools don't integrate into the workflow.  More 'tailored'
Problem based topics - How do I...?


Length / Frequency
Consider timing in terms of relation to grant deadlines / project initiation / calendar year
Web conference for MNs
Webconference (facilitated discussion) around a topic / problem / emerging policy / activity within the wider community

 * No more than 1 hour (including Q&A)
 * Shorter is better
 * 30 minutes with optional Q&A
 * Depends on nature of webinar (conveptual vs instructional)
 * Frustrations associated with poorly organized webinars
 * Regular schedule important
 * 1/month


Screencasts
About 4 people have looked at the tool, about 2 people have used it to pull data

Basic search feedback:
Shading
 * shading focussed attenion
 * important early on, less important later
 * highlighting important where there is no cursor action
Subtitles
 * subtitles needed for non native speakers
 * also for critical features (such as the AND behavior)
 * subtitles for references to other video 
 * replace the title in sub bar with information relevant to the action
Animation on the click was nice

Geographic search feedback:
 * Arrows good bc you are not actually clicking on everything (highlight vs action)
 * Pan into bar before shading in bc shading was too large
 * Use the pan function more, it was helpful
 * Focus on things that are specific to the tool (for example: overlap and enclose more important that zoom in / out)
 * If it's a step based tutorial, say the steps up front

Have a page with tutorials and also a glossary
Think about where the screencast starts
Make sure you show everything you mention
Black box was distracting - didn't change very often


Prioritization
 * DMPTool in need of screencasts
 * Prioritize DataONE and DataONE partner tools
 * If new versioning is expected, wait on creating screencasts
 * Use the STs as a framework
 * Library of other screencast / edu resources??
 * Release tool with education materials (even if it delays the release of the tool)
 * Though there is an opportunity to have multiple message broadcasts
 * Release overview video important at release, can augment with specifics later

Webinar discussion:

Topics:
 * Domain specificity - use cases
 * ONER, other toolkit items
 * Programmatic workflows - reproducability end to end, including experimental pipellines
 * Writing a DMP for your grant (aimed at researchers)
 * Latest tools
 * Data Management best practices for facility managers
 * Rights management and DataONE (recommended in MN session)
 * Workflow tools like kepler and taverna
 * Panel webinar for citizen science (profiling projects for citizen science)
 * Issues in DM targeted to various data types
 * Benefits of being a Member Node (for potential new MNs)
 * What is metadata? How do I create it? How do I use it? What tools can I use for metadata management? 
 * What is metadata - how to create it / use it / tools for helping
 * Describing tools that will help people find data (domain specific?)
 * For a repo manager - how to choose what goes in DataONE when joining as a MN (raised in MN session)
 * Escaping excel: free ways to manage data outside excel (transition tools - data moves)
 * Benefits of sharing data (incl use case)
 * Helping PIs / Data creators understand metadata and how it's used - with use cases.  e.g. How do you make your data discoverable?
 * Provenance and why it's used, why it's important to you
 * How to increase the quality of your data
 * Protecting your legacy (info on sharing for retiring researchers)
 * Work with specific MNs to help people in the community deposit data
 * Data Life Cycle for specific domains

Length/Frequency:
 * 1 hr
 * Questions after
 * Monthly
 * Repeating (i.e., twice a month, same presentation)
 * Think about timing in terms of international participation
 * Have longer (flexible) timing depending on topic - if having a panel presenting perspectives on the same idea)
 * For internationals or people that can't call in, allow opportunity for questions to asked in advanced or contributed post viewing.
 * Research the need / niche for the webinar - a lot of stuff out there (point people to the other material)



Screencasts:
5 people have been to ONEMercury and searched ONEMercury

Basic search feedback
 * need for spotlight depends on how much of the page is being shown - mouse can get lost
 * spotlight considered helpful
 * zooming helpful if not moving in and out too much.  being zoomed out helps people with context
 * Too much time one non essential if keeping at 1 minute (e.g. where to find other tutorials)

Geographic search
 * Arrows provide nice contrast
 * Gradual fade on spotlight?
 * No-one read the text in the black box
 * Summary text at the end of the steps (take home points)


 * Generic or specific?  Have a speerate one - an example search using ONEMercury
 * A 'poweruser' example

Prioritization
 * Start with DataONE tools - wont have been done already, have inside information on versioning, can synchronization
 * Dont' neccesarily do a full set on a (partner) tool - focus on the parts that are unique or complex
 * Need to think carefully about the synchronization - don't want to have the redo and frustrate users, don't want to frustrate developers by 'holding' a product for release
