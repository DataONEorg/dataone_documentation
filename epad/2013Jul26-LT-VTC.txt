Agenda for 2013-07-26

1) CI Update (Vieglais)

Campus network upgrade at UNM caused some issues with the DataONE infrastructure.

Push another upgrade to CN, altering method to manage/administer SOLR. Will reduce and streamline ADMIN in future easier, reduce time, etc. 

MN Forum call yesterday - focus moving ahead rapidly. Issues related to CN updates were discussed. 

CI running as expected. 

Adding new capabilities to Search index, performance improvements to ONEDrive are being done.  

New version of Metacat is being pushed out in prep. for ESA meeting. 

Beta version of ONEDrive out in 2 weeks or so. Goal obtaining more feedback on UA.

Mercury related discussions Summary (Dave can fill in when he is done):
Issues surrounding immutability
Two fixes:
 * Use of series identifiers - point to all of the revisions of an object - default would be latest revision (timeline: middle of design phase - hope to deploy by AHM)
 * Moving some control over metadata back to Member Nodes - differences in metadata are detected by checksums; if move control back to MN, they would determine which changes in metadata are significant (timeline: follow the above and more significant so probably won't happen before the end of the year - more likely 1Q14Y)

Will these address the issues with dynamic (streaming) data?  Not really - have the option of doing snapshots if have streaming data
Could also build in subsetting service/functionality (this is difficult because no consistent way to do dataset (? these aren't really datasets?) slicing across different types of data

Solution for CUAHSI and NEON? Moving these into production would be challenging - need a broad solution
Use case for changing dataset. Publish episodic versions (saw annually) but many MN's also express a desire to publish a non-static (i.e. mutable) latest, up-to-date live stream. In addition to those that Bill mentions, NPN wants this. They plan to be deployed by end of Y5Q1.

Semantics would be to understand that the live feed is NOT immutable, but rather convenient.


2) CEE WG  (Koskela) 
CEE needs to replace two members.  Viv Hutchison and Josh Tewksbury.  When   considering the domain expertise, group needs and group diversity, CEE came up with two separate lists for consideration.  The first was a new co-chair and the second an individual who was most likely to engage in education material development.  As the co-chair position was  discussed  first, and a (female) candidate identified, we chose to focus on only male candidates for the second position in order to maintain  group  diversity. Five candidates were put forward for each position and in both cases, the CEE WG reviewed all candidate materials prior to voting.  Due to the nature of the process, if one of the first candidates is unable to participate, we can move on to a second choice without delay.  It is  intended that these candidates would come on board immediately for a CEE  teleconference and be required to commit to both the AHM and next spring CEE WG meeting to maximize participation prior to the end of the grant cycle. 

Candidates
Co-chair
Gail Steinhart 
Research Data and Environmental Sciences Librarian at Cornell
http://vivo.cornell.edu/display/individual7769
Endorsement/bio  from  Stephanie Wright (current CEE member): Gail Steinhart is the  Research Data and Environmental Sciences Librarian at Cornell.  She  moderated a panel I was on about assessments of researcher data management needs.  She is just concluding a Digital Scholarship Fellowship at Cornell: http://staffweb.library.cornell.edu/node/2577.  She has a background in ecology and environmental science.  Great ideas, very nice and easy to work with.

Member

Endorsement/bio  from Cliff Duke (current CEE member): He's  an environmental educator,  currently based in DC, and definitely works  well with others. Not an  academic, and would likely be interested.
Votes: 
Yes: Unanimous
No: zero

3) Proposal Workshop Update (Michener)

Most were at the workshop (exception of Carol) so quick summary -
Successful but hard 3 days; many options to review and identified the core CE activities
and prioritized other activities if funding allows
More discussion upcoming
CI group also identified the core CI needs if have to stick to $10M and what could be included if another $2M-$4M is available.  Options were prioritized.
Next 2-4 weeks, office staff will work with Amber and WGs that have been identified
(CE, UA/Sociocultural,S&G, CCIT)
Will run the various options identified so budgets will be available with each option
Rough outline of proposal is in google docs
**Will need a LT in about a month to discuss what will be included in the proposal

Hope to submit the white paper in October to allow NSF to give feedback

Bill and Rebecca will be meeting with Amber, Trisha, Carol, & Suzie and CI folks

Working Group: Public Participation in Scientific Research
Co-Chairs: Rick Bonney and Greg Newman
Date: July 25, 2012

Overall Objective:
 
Identify the scope, scale, and diversity of PPSR data used in scientific research and barriers to broader use of these data. Provide recommendations for improving quality, quantity, and accessibility of these data; generate recommendations and/or tools to advance integration of data in conventional science.
 
Milestones for the next 12 months:
 
 * Widely disseminate to the PPSR field our two new data guides: The Guide to Managing Data in PPSR projects described in the last report and our new Guide to Data Policies for PPSR Projects written by our summer intern, Anne Bowser
 * Translate both guides into interactive web formats for use on www.citizenscience.org 
 * Publish an academic paper based on the Data Policies Guide 
 * Submit a revised paper on models for the collection of field-based citizen science observational data with colleagues at U of Minn computer science department (Wiggins)
 * Continue working on developing a core data exchange standard for the sharing of PPSR related data and associated datasets. This data exchange protocol (PPSR_CORE) will define core data fields and formats related to PPSR programs. It will identify required data fields and formats along with optional fields. The standard will be delivered and supported as both a JSON-based and an XML-based protocol to facilitate third party data provider Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) development to seamlessly share and exchange PPSR data and metadata. It is envisioned that PPSR_CORE will be used by RESTful web services to consume and share data about PPSR programs and data generated by PPSR programs. The proposed PPSR_CORE protocol will form the basis of the newly developed CitizenScience.org web application and database that will facilitate searching of PPSR programs and associated datasets. Finally, the protocol will also facilitate data exchange and sharing with DataONE member nodes and will lead to the easy development of third party data provider web services to make it easier for PPSR programs to contribute data to DataONE member nodes.
 * Continue developing the outline and data-collection validation for a large-scale research project/paper that will be based, in part, from data generated by deployment of the above-mentioned data exchange protocol (DUST; Data Usage Study)
 * Continue work on a major paper on Guidelines for Effective Data Management targeted toward potential program managers, data managers, data users, and the broad scientific community
 * Complete (with several individuals external to the WG) a manuscript for an upcoming issue of Issues in Ecology focused on conservation/policy outcomes of PPSR
 
Accomplishments from the past three months:
 
·      Held working group meeting in Ithaca, NY in May, 2013

Accomplishments
From past three months
 
May 2013
Enhancements to UV-CDAT code made by Jorge Poco (DataONE EVA) were incorporated into UV-CDAT and made publicly available through the binary code repository. 
 
May – July 2013
Held a series of monthly teleconferences of an EVA Subgroup on the topic “Visualization-based methods and techniques for facilitating climate model intercomparison.”  One part of this activity was to collect figures (maps, scatter plots, bar charts, line plots) from the literature and critique the effectiveness of these plots.  The other part of this activity is to have the EVA WG (researchers and visualization experts) develop alternative methods for visualizing the data.  Ultimately the group will develop a set of best practices for visualizing complex data.
 
June 2013
“Visualization-based Approaches for Intercomparison of Terrestrial Biosphere Models”, Seminar by Aritra Dasgupta, DataONE Post-Doc, at Climate Change Science Institute, ORNL
 
July 2013

This project focused on building several fundamental components of an Integrated Model-data Intercomparison Framework (IMIF).  In addition, the EVA summer intern project was closely integrated with the Provenance WG intern project. The EVA summer intern project was successful and made a number of significant achievements, including:
 
1)  Implemented a well-documented UV-CDAT/VisTrails package "IMIF" which includes core visualization and analysis modules for carbon cycle model-data intercomparison research.
2)  Implemented a collection of scientific workflows for selected carbon cycle model-data intercomparison research scenarios, including Daymet climatology summary data creation, model-data spatial pattern, and time series comparisons.
3)  Set up VisTrails in server mode and developed a Web-based VisTrails workflow framework. 
4)  Integrated the EVA workflows with PBase and DataONE Cyber Infrastructure to enable provenance preservation, management, and discovery. (TBD)
 
The DataONE EVA summer intern project was an important first step for the full IMIF framework. It has been a successful collaboration among DataONE EVA WG, the North American Carbon Program (NACP) modeling community, and the UV-CDAT/VisTrails community (e.g. Polytechnic Institute of New York University and USGS).
 
July 2013
Submitted two proposals that incorporate / leverages EVA activities.  The proposal was submitted to the Interagency (NASA, DOE, USDA) Carbon Cycle Science solicitation.   The other proposal was submitted to the NSF EarthCube Building Blocks solicitation.
 
June – July 2013
An EVA subgroup started a visualization-enabled analysis of climate model similarity, addressing the question are results from different models (or models and observations) similar.  The approach in this activity is to use multidimensional projections / dimensionality reduction algorithms to understand similarity and investigate in detail, why, where, and when models are similar.

Co-chairs: Bertram Ludaescher & Paolo Missier
Date: July 26, 2013

[ important / new stuff has a star "*" at the beginning of the line]

Overall Objective (no change)
- Deliver the value of provenance metadata to the DataONE user community, specifically: develop an open and extensible provenance management architecture for scientific data processing systems (e.g., workflows and scripting languages such as R).    

Specific Goals and Products  
- DataONE Provenance Model (D-OPM/D-PROV), 
- suitable query languages and prototypes (e.g. based on RPQ queries),
- prototype workflows (with EVA WG: VisTrails/UV-CDAT workflows)
- generic tools (e.g., ProvenanceExplorer)
* PBase summer internship prototype

Milestones for next 12 months (no change)
* 2-3 months: initial PBase prototype development (summer internship)
* mid-term: research on scalable provenance queries

Semantics Working Group Report:

Milestones for next 12 months: 
Future work for this project includes:
 *  
 * Work with Dave Vieglas (CCIT) for testing the performance of search with and without the additional knowledge structures we are developing.
 * Additional future work includes leveraging DataONE’s metadata environment, for example accessing eBird metadata and data through DataONE mechanisms, when available.
·       Update a set of tasks and a mentorship plan for the Post-Doctoral scholar, Patrice Seyed, to correspond with the goals and objectives of the working group.  The initial task is focused on leveraging one or more of the semantic tools and infrastructure at RPI on DataOne data.  
·       Examine the DataONE ONEDrive protototype and provide recommendations for how semantics could be used to improve the organizational/folder structure.
·       Continue to develop and refine use cases to drive our work.  Our initial interdisciplinary use case leverages expertise from group members around hydrology and ecology.  It is available at: https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/integration-and-semantics/products/use-cases/Data-Integration-and-Semantics-Working-Group-HydroEco-Use-Case-Draft.docx/view.  This use case also has been created to demonstrate the need for and show how semantic technologies can enhance data discovery and integration.
·       Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) group working toward specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data.  Work has begun on this effort including discussions among members Seyed, Schildhauer, McGuinness and SONet and DataONE member from SBC LTER Obrien and the new SONet postdoc.
·       Face to face meetings will include a meeting at the 2013 all hands meeting as well as one other meeting to be planned. 
 
Accomplishments from past 6 months: 
 
 * Postdoc Patrice Seyed has been working with DataONE intern Katherine Chastain and some summer RPI students on the SemantEco Annotator, submitting to the ISWC Demonstration track an abstract and video for consideration.
 * Patrice has also been working on a semantic disambiguation of geospatial entities , leveraging existing bioporal ontologies. Resulted in a submission to the ISWC ‘Consuming Linked Open Data’ Workshop.
 * Patrice has been involved in a Data Integration project with the Darrin Freshwater Institute and RPI, that has leveraged the SemantEco framework and web application for semantic integration of water quality and phythoplantkon data. This data has served as a driving use case for the DataONE internship.
 * In collaboration with working group members and also Sonet postdoc Ben Adams, DataONE postdoc Stacy Hespania, authored DataONE newsletter article, on the topics of semantic data integration and also topic modeling.
 * Wrote internship proposal and successfully recruited and hired students for those internships.
 * Held successful face-to-face working group meeting, including refinements to the Hydro-Eco Use case.
 * “SemantEco: A Next-Generation Web Observatory” accepted paper at the 1st International Web Observatory Workshop at the World Wide Web Conference, Seyed, McGuiness.

 * Patrice Seyed (postdoctoral fellow) has been leading the development of  the Hydro-Eco use case infrastructure and supporting ontologies, which now supports multi-domain environment quality data (water, air), exploring and visualizing species data (i.e., bird data from eBird, fish data from SBC-LTER) simultaneously with environment data, and dynamic hierarchical faceted exploration of chemicals (e.g., Arsenic) and species (e.g., Rock Eagle Owl) for enhanced searching capabilities.  It has also benefited from some involvement from McGuinness’ students in her semantic eScience class this term, thereby providing outreach to additional students as well as gaining the benefits of additional labor on, for example, some additional data identification and conversion.
·       Patrice has been developing hierarchical knowledge structures by extracting/modularizing community ontologies for improving search that currently is performed by matching the approximately 10k terms in the Apache SOLR index.
·       Suppawong Tuarob, DataONE Summer intern from Penn State, worked remotely under the collective mentorship of Line Pouchard, Jeff Horsburgh, Natasha Noy, and Giri Palanisamy to identify, implement, and evaluate automated text extraction techniques to enrich the metadata for ONEMercury.  His work examined how discovery of data might be improved through the DataONE ONEMercury data discovery client through the use of semantic technologies.  He examined initial sets of metadata from the ORNL DAAC, KNB, and Dryad.
