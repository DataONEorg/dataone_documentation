DataONE mission:
Enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about life on earth and the environment that sustains it.


Working Group Charter DRAFT – May 2010

Background  
The Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) is poised to be the foundation of new innovative environmental science through a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data.  Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, DataONE will ensure the preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national science data.  DataONE will transcend domain boundaries and make biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; make environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; provide secure and long-term preservation and access; and engage scientists, land-managers, policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualizations.  Most importantly, DataONE is not an end but a means to serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network.
 
Working Groups
Working Groups are central to DataONE in conducting research, specifying cyberinfrastructure, and engaging the community. The Working Group model will allow DataONE to conduct targeted research and education activities with a broad group of scientists and users. Working Groups are also designed to enable research and education activities to evolve over time. Each Working Group will have two co-leaders who organize the activity and propose solutions to particular research, education, and cyberinfrastructure problems.

Purpose, Scope, Mission
This working group will research the social and cultural context of the scientific data lifecycle to devise strategies that maximize the impact of DataONE.

This working group will think and visualize from large-scale, long-term perspectives the socio-cultural aspects of data management, data use, data sharing and preservation.

This working group is responsible for informing the efforts of DataONE from a set of diverse perspectives: sociocultural, international and interdisciplinary. The working group engages in identifying, assessing and developing models, frameworks, definitions and theories. 

The working group succeeds by inspiring innovations in the data practices of scientists and other stakeholders to ensure preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline and multi-national environmental science data.



Duration of Working Group
 * Constituted in Y1Q3
 * Operating for the duration of the project


Major Objectives
 * Establish a research program to identify social and cultural issues within the stakeholder communities that facilitate or inhibit effective data sharing and long-term preservation;
   * Understand work practices, norms and beliefs of stakeholders throughout the scientific lifecycle as they relate to data;
   * Understand how the organizational, institutional and disciplinary environments of stakeholders impact scientific data sharing and long term preservation;
 * Facilitate alignment between D1--tools, technologies, practices and policies--and practices of users and their environments;
   * Evaluate and recommend strategies for D1 development and implementation that overcome socio-cultural barriers identified;
   * Inform other working groups about the social/cultural context relevant to their work;
 * Facilitate the transformation of  cultures around data across the breadth of stakeholders;
   * Evaluate and recommend strategies that encourage and support cultural change related to the data lifecyle;
   * Identify incentives and  disincentives, enablers and barriers to preparing data for sharing, preservation and reuse; 
   * Increase recognition of the value of  good data practices; and
   * Explore and make recommendation regarding the roles for stakeholder and strategic partner communities in training data authors, supporting data curation and acting as a facilitator of digital preservation practices.

Potential Risks/Mitigation strategies
 * Lack of participation by Working Group members due to loss of interest; mitigated by periodic reviews of membership of working group and rotation off and recruitment of new members
 * Lack of participation by Working Group members due to lack of time (in general or at key points); mitigated by careful planning of work, agreed contribution and communication of availability
 * Lost focus or not focusing on specific problems that address DataONE concerns; mitigated by keeping in touch with other working groups to determine needs and wants
 * Not delivering useful information at the right time; mitigated by incorporating needs and wants in planning of work and reports
 * Taken away from our primary mission by demands of project and other Working Groups; mitigated by focus on primary mission in planning
 * Misunderstanding our stakeholders and their environments; mitigated by use of appropriate data collection and analysis approaches and checking results with stakeholders
