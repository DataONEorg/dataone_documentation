Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions: 

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
 *  CN issue - phase 2 ...  has begun (it will take a while to complete), index has been regenerated and looks complete, now verifying content on CNs matches what is on the MNs
   * update: in process of wrapping up phase 2 remainder of this week; anticipate being able to add new MNs
 * "dashboard" should be able to move to production soon after
 * few other issues (odd dates, some data not being harvested) should resolve after this
 

2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.
 * MN Operations documentation - on hold


3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:
 

    
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
Corinna (GLEON) - issues with Morpho latest version have been resolved, and a couple datasets are out there (success!!); now we need to "sell" this to users (

Ed (NKN) - registered in sandbox; need an accepted metadata standards list  http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/SearchMetadata.html
    ISO 19115-2 - Karl Benedict said he had been having some trouble getting his data up there with this m/d std; a lot of NKN's data is under this std
    Maybe start with EML and work on getting the ISO 19115-2 data out there
    Or, maybe work with Morpho (see GLEON)
    Roger can help, or Ed can get on IRC for questions
    
Mark (LTER) - status quo, waiting for tidy phase 2 to complete to run out PASTA GMN

Ryan (Dryad) - ~5500 records were not harvesting, discovered that ~150 had schema problems, now we have to figure out what's up with the remainder
    next step, figure out how to move to next tiers of operation
    Dave suggests a call next week to make a plan for moving forward (perhaps the Weds 2pm EDT standing call)

If you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed here, please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org.
