    -- http://bugzilla.ecoinformatics.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&target_milestone=2.2.0&product=Kepler
    -- The dates for 2.2 are in https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/build/kepler-release-roadmap/?searchterm=roadmap
    -- David will be release coordinator for 2.2
    -- Feature freeze Jan 15, release Feb 15, depending on estimates of hours by developers
    
3. Proposal: Kepler should require Java 1.6 for all platforms starting with the Kepler 2.2 release.  For background, see the discussion thread on this issue on kepler-dev.
    -- Decsion: require 1.6 -- doesn't drop too many users, simplifies deployment
