Tasks

CN Development
  - List of member nodes (Robert)
    The CN needs to record a list of member nodes.  
    This can be a config file that record domain name of the MN, and include other static information about the MNs that is required for CN interaction with them.
    - static text / config file
    
  - Index updating (Chad)
    - Metacat needs to be modified so that notification of science and system metadata is available to trigger the packaging of science metdata + system metdata so that it appears in the Mercury index.  System metadata is recorded for data objects and science metadata objects.  The trigger should distinguish between changes to the system metadata associated with data and the system metadata associated with science metadata, since only sysmeta associated with science metadata needs to be packaged.  The trigger should respond to both inserts through the data one create() method and also in response to content change in response to metacat replication activity.
