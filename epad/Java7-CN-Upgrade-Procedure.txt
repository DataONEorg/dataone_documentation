Upgrade Ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04


1. Prepare
  For Production machines follow the procedure as outlined in http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/coordinating_node_deployment/upgrade.html
  
 Remove the previous dataone installation, this is due to conflicts of dependencies (sort of)
   root@cn-cat-1/# apt-get remove --purge dataone-cn-os-core
   root@cn-cat-1:/# apt-get remove dataone-cn-version-tool
   root@cn-cat-1:/# rm /var/cache/apt/archives/dataone*
   root@cn-cat-1:/# rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/dataone*

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install update-manager-core

sudo vim /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
(Verify that the line presents in the file: Prompt=lts)

2. Do upgrade

sudo do-release-upgrade

notes:

on cn-stage-ucsb-1.test.dataone.org the following error occurred:

Updating repository information
WARNING: Failed to read mirror file

No valid mirror found 

While scanning your repository information no mirror entry for the 
upgrade was found. This can happen if you run a internal mirror or if 
the mirror information is out of date. 

Do you want to rewrite your 'sources.list' file anyway? If you choose 
'Yes' here it will update all 'lucid' to 'precise' entries. 
If you select 'No' the upgrade will cancel. 

(selected y)

The first time I did this the upgrade failed.  I then commented out all lists in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list and tried again. I got to the following messages:

Do you want to start the upgrade? 


2 installed packages are no longer supported by Canonical. You can 
still get support from the community. 

7 packages are going to be removed. 144 new packages are going to be 
installed. 393 packages are going to be upgraded. 

You have to download a total of 244 M. This download will take about 
31 minutes with a 1Mbit DSL connection and about 9 hours with a 56k 
modem. 

Fetching and installing the upgrade can take several hours. Once the 
download has finished, the process cannot be canceled. 



If you continue, an additional ssh daemon will be started at port '1022'. 
Do you want to continue? Continue [yN] y

Starting additional sshd 
To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will 
be started on port '1022'. If anything goes wrong with the running 
ssh you can still connect to the additional one. 
If you run a firewall, you may need to temporarily open this port. As 
this is potentially dangerous it's not done automatically. You can 
open the port with e.g.: 
'iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT' 
To continue please press [ENTER] enter


Third party sources disabled 
Some third party entries in your sources.list were disabled. You can 
re-enable them after the upgrade with the 'software-properties' tool 
or your package manager. 
To continue please press [ENTER] enter

4. Merge postgresql from 8.4 to 9.1

(on cn-stage-ucsb-1 Postgresql 9.1 not installed)
apt-get install postgresql-9.1

Please see the https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/4467
Migrate the database data from Postgresql 8.4 to 9.1 (after the upgrade, the system has both 8.4 and 9.1 running):
  a. stop both 8.4 and 9.1 server:
       sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop
        
  b. make some links as the root:
       sudo -s
       ln -s /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/
       ln -s /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main/
        
  c. run the upgrade script with the —check option as user postgresql:

    root@cn-cat-1:~# su - postgres
    postgres@cn-cat-1:~$ /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_upgrade --check -b /usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin -B /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin -d /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main
    
    (if the postgres can't start, the command can be helpful:
     "/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl" -w  -D "/var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main" -o "-p 5432 -b" start)
   (in cn-dev-unm-1, i have to increase shared memory size:
    echo 3221225472 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
    and edit /etc/sysctl.conf
    add a line kernel.shmmax = 3221225472 )

  d. do a real upgrade as user postgresql:
  
      postgres@cn-stage-ucsb-1:~$ vi upgradePostgres.sh
       #!/bin/bash
       echo `date` >>  /tmp/pg_upgrade.out
      /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_upgrade -b /usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin -B /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin -d /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main  >> /tmp/pg_upgrade.out 2> /tmp/pg_upgrade.err < /dev/null 
      echo `date` >>  /tmp/pg_upgrade.out
      
      postgres@cn-stage-ucsb-1:~$ chmod 750  upgradePostgres.sh
      postgres@cn-cat-1:~$ nohup /var/lib/postgresql/upgradePostgres.sh &
      on a staging this took a really long time.
      postgres@cn-cat-1:~$ exit
      
  e. remove 8.4:
        root@cn-dev-ucsb-1:~# apt-get remove postgresql-8.4
        Do you want to continue [Y/n]? Y
  f. edit the file /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf as the user postgres:
        root@cn-cat-1:~# su - postgres
        postgres@cn-cat-1:~$  vi /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf
        change the port to 5432
        postgres@cn-cat-1:~$  exit
  g. start postgresql 9.1:
       root@cn-dev-ucsb-1:~#/etc/init.d/postgresql start
        
  h. vaccum db as the user postgres
       root@cn-cat-1:~# su - postgres
       postgres@cn-stage-ucsb-1:~$ vi vacuumPostgres.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        echo `date` >>  /tmp/vacuumdb.out
         /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/vacuumdb --all >> /tmp/vacuumdb.out 2> /tmp/vacuumdb.err < /dev/null
        echo `date` >>  /tmp/vacuumdb.out
        
        postgres@cn-stage-ucsb-1:~$ chmod 750  vacuumPostgres.sh
        postgres@cn-cat-1:~$ nohup /var/lib/postgresql/vacuumPostgres.sh &

        (also takes a long time in staging, 9 hrs on cn-stage-unm-1)
        
5.install tomcat7:


a. Install libtomcat7-java
   
   root@cn-dev-ucsb-1:~# apt-get install libtomcat7-java
    Do you want to continue [Y/n]? Y

   
b. install tomcat7
   root@cn-cat-1:/#  apt-get install tomcat7


6 Add a new file dataone.list in the directory  /etc/apt/sources.list.d as root:

The new file contains two lines:

for cn-dev machines:
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-unstable precise universe 
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-extra precise universe 

for cn-sandbox machines:
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-beta precise universe 
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-extra precise universe 

for cn-stage and cn-production machines:
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-stable precise universe 
deb [arch=amd64] http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/ubuntu-extra precise universe 

6.1 sudo apt-get update
6.2 sudo apt-get upgrade
    upgrade packages (check-mk-agent check-mk-agent-logwatch libnoggit-java) from ubuntu-extra
    Install these packages without verification [y/N]? y
    replace file `/etc/xinetd.d/check_mk'? N
    if not propmpted to replace the check_mk file, then it is likely that check-mk-agent may not be configured correctly
    add the line 
    only_from      = 129.237.201.155 128.111.84.5
    to /etc/xinetd.d/check_mk
    
7.Install dataone-cn-os-core
 a  edit /etc/ldap/slapd.d/cn=config.ldif
     comment three lines that start with:
      olcTLSCACertificateFile:
      olcTLSCertificateFile: 
      olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: 

b  apt-get install slapd
  
  
 c change the Java7 keystore password: 
    sudo keytool -storepasswd -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts
  
 d sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-os-core
  
   for all debian installs: Install these packages without verification [y/N]? y
    
   Is this the first CN? No
   keystore password:
   ldap password
  
   confirm that bouncycastle has been installed correctly
   /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/ext should contain
     bcmail-jdk16-1.46.jar
     bcprov-jdk16-1.46.jar

  if not, then perform the following operation:
  dpkg-reconfigure dataone-cn-os-core

  Enable nodes for single active master mode
  edit /etc/dataone/node.properties file
  on the orc and unm node add the following line:
  cn.storage.readOnly=true
  
8.Install dataone-cn-metacat
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-metacat 
b. Takes 30 minutes for tomcat7  to come back up after manual update, might be best to perform metacat manual upgrades after  everything else is installed!
c. go through the metacat admin page (bypass geo server and data one configuration. The others just click “save” - except to change the deploy directory to tomcat7)


9.Install dataone-cn-portal
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-portal 

10.Install dataone-cn-rest-service
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-rest-service 

11.Install dataone-cn-solr
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-solr 

12.Install dataone-cn-processdaemon
  a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-processdaemon 
  b. Log Aggregation is not repeating executions in branch and tags, modify the logAggregation.properties file to run from minutes execution(fixed in beta release)
    
13.Install dataone-cn-index
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-cn-index


14.Install dataone-mercury
a. sudo apt-get install dataone-mercury 

15.Total installed packages (checking and optional step):
tao@cn-dev-orc-1:/usr/share$ dpkg --get-selections | grep dataone
dataone-cn-index                                install
dataone-cn-metacat                                install
dataone-cn-os-core                                install
dataone-cn-portal                                install
dataone-cn-processdaemon                        install
dataone-cn-rest-service                                install
dataone-cn-solr                                        install
dataone-cn-version-tool                                install
dataone-mercury                                        install

16. Final Step- Remove unneeded packages
  
sudo apt-get remove --purge sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-jre  sun-java6-bin tomcat6 solr-common solr-tomcat
    will ask if you wish to remove solr index data, select no

17 start the dataone service
 sudo /usr/local/bin/startDaemons.sh
