All,
Thanks much to all for a highly productive teleconference.

We have the following actions:

1.  Done:  Michael Keller to send an example description for data products from NEON.  We will use this description to craft a 100-word abstract describing the data product (why and what), along with a table of quantitative information (spatial and temporal resolution and extent).  The link to the NEON Data Products:
http://www.neoninc.org/sites/default/files/NEON%20high%20level%20data%20products%20catalog%20Spring%202010.pdf

2.  Done:  Kamel to send a link to the data product white papers.  http://landportal.gsfc.nasa.gov/
Click on "NASA ESDRs - View White Paper link" at the lower right
corner section of the page.

3.  Each member is to choose three of the 28 data records to describe using the template in #1 above.  Please refer to the excel file sent out on April 12, or slides 12-13 in the powerpoint file for today's teleconference.  Please make choices in the next few days and complete your descriptions by June 1.  Please post your choices here (first come, first served):
