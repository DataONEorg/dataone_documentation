ConCall:  Claudio, Aritra, Yaxing, and Bob
 
1.     Planning for UV-CDAT activities
a.     Make EVA version of UV-CDAT available to Christopher, Rosie, Yaxing, and others 
                   i.     controlled version, linked to main development version 
b.     Add documentation for the EVA functionality (VisTrails modules and UV-CDAT tools)
c.      Improving performance of UV-CDAT
                  i.     General impression that UV-CDAT is slow
                        1.     Need to test with large data
                                we have some very large model output data sets (Terrabytes of global/monthly/100years, global/3-hourly/31years) for testing
ACTION:  Yaxing and Aritra to investigate

                 ii.     Version of UV-CDAT / VisTrals for HPC?
                 iii.     Co-located with data
                 iv.     XSEDE?
 d.  add documentation, as needed, on installation and setup
 
 
2.     Develop basic and common analysis modules for VisTrails
    a.     Subsetting
    b.     Units conversion 
    c.      Regridding
    d.     Others…….
    e.     ??? upgrade “search” feature for VisTrails module library ??
    
Two things to look at:
    SAHM: http://www.fort.usgs.gov/products/software/sahm/
        (main developer: Colin Talbert, http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Staff/staffprofile.asp?StaffID=518)
    CDAT VisTrails package
       --> need to make the CDAT package more user friendly by Climate Model Benchmark purpose in Vistrails and UV-CDAT. We can call that EVA package
 
 ACTION:  Aritra and investigate SAHM and CDAT
 
3.     Benchmarking analysis tools for UV/CDAT 
    a.     Work with Forrest, Christopher, and others 
    b.     Benchmarking analysis, exploration and visualization
    c.      Benchmark scoring tools
                 i.     Suite of scoring code available in R, MatLab, IDL
 
4.     Travel to MsTMIP workshop in ABQ
    a.     Jorge and Aritra – demo UV-CDAT, help download and install, seek feedback 
  
5.     Hargrove Idea (Bill Hargrove, http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/staff/825)
    a.     Toggle feature for Model structural characteristics
    b.     Aritra is interested in pursuing this toggling feature; and Jorge has already begun this activity
 
6.     Link with Provenance Working Group
    a.     EVA Use case
    b.     Incorporate workflows they develop
    c.      Suggest that Aritra join
 
7.     Link EVA with David Koop’s DataONE VisTrails tool set
        a.     DataONE python client placed into VisTrails
                     i.     Search and access (need subset from DataONE CI)
                    ii.     Publish data to Member Node
