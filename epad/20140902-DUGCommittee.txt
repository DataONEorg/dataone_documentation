Draft invitation to join the DUG to send to Phase I non-members:

Dear [name]

Thank you for your service to DataONE [as a member of the XYZ working group] during Phase I, which concluded in July 2014.

I would like to personally invite you to keep abreast of [or stay involved with] DataONE as a member of the DataONE Users Group (https://www.dataone.org/dug-member-form).

The DataONE Users Group (DUG) is the worldwide community of Earth observation data authors, users, and diverse stakeholders that makeup the DataONE partnership communities. The DUG represents the needs and interests of these communities in the activities of DataONE and provides guidance that facilitates DataONE in achieving its vision and mission.

Individuals, not organizations, join the DUG. There are no dues or membership fees. DUG members may attend the annual DUG meeting, which is typically collocated with the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meeting each summer.

I hope you’ll take a few moments to join the DUG by completing the short online form at https://www.dataone.org/dug-member-form. 

Best regards,

Bill Michener or Amber Budden or Rebecca Koskela and DUG co-chairs Andrew and Chris
