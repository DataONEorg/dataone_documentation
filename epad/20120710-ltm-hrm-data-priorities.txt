Historical data collation and prioritization 
==============================

July 10, 2012

Participants
-----------------
Matt Jones, Derik Barsegh, Jim, Brenda, Sarah, Rob, Darcy, Kim

Overview of project prioritization
-----------------------------------------------
Two ways to prioritize
-- Focus on data that might be lost
-- Focus on data important for mid-term synthesis report
-- Focus on data useful to be summarized for the 25th anniversary
    -- which implies focus on current time, with retrospective on changes that have happened
-- Focus on data with consistent long term time series

Some data sets will span project clusters, while others might be within a single cluster or project


Case study with Brenda Ballachey's data
-----------------------------------------------------------
-- Has her populaiton surveys from the mid 90s
   -- started under clusterID284, continued in all of them
-- Kim critical to inderstanding all of them
-- Should also link to the other funded projects, e.g., Bodkin & USGS group & Ballachey
-- Brenda, Kim, and Heather want to devote more time to this, but its going to be hard to find them
-- Population survey data for sea otters: Rob has a full copy up until recently
    -- Rob: discrepancies with transect IDs to be resolved
    -- Rob: will get a copy to Sarah

Moving forward
----------------------
Pursue two prongs simultaneously
-- first, continue trying to get prioritization
-- second, Sarah starts on some clusters of data to understand the process and time scale

Consider how to coordinate historical and current when they are ongoing time series

How to get other input
--------------------------------
-- Wait for people to return from the field
-- Will need Jeep and Russ amd Tom Weingartner to identify point of contacts for pelagic and environmental drivers data sets
-- Jim Bodkin and Tom Dean will also have a broad feeling for the breadth of projects
-- DD Bone (USGS liaison with EVOSTC), and worked with FWS
-- Pete Hagan (NOAA)
-- Sue Saupe (Cook Inlet RCAC)
-- Molly McCammon

Plan on Fall meeting having a session to identify other gaps

Non-EVOS funded as well
--------------------------------------
-- Exxon data sets
-- From literature published studies
