DataONE Developer Call - 2010-12-01
===================================

:Attendees:
  Paul Allen, Roger Dahl, Bob Sandusky, Bruce Wilson, Dave Vieglais, Ryan Scherle, Matt Jones, John Kunze, Mark Servilla, Chad Berkley, Rob Nahf

:New Actions:
  - (Mark): Check on Ken Klingensteins PPTs from the Fed Sec workshop for SAML examples. 
  - (Dave): 


Agenda
------

There are two major, somewhat inter-related topics that could benefit from some discussion: security (authn, authz) and search.

0. Preservation meeting in Chicago
- Agenda coming out soon
- work at writing narrative, technical assessment perhaps later in conjunction with CCIT
- No real documentation / strategy for preservation have been formally described for DataONE
- For Jan/Feb need a good story for the review process
- Ryan may have a microphone that we can borrow (contact on Friday if necessary)
- 

1. General discussion and update on Security: Authentication and Authorization

* Authentication prototyping plans and status
  - https://repository.dataone.org/software/AuthNPrototype/
  - Branding for CILogon - minimally logo and color 
  - Graphics at https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/documents/copy_of_graphics

  - Developing a prototype web service that will accept a CILogon cert for verification and generate DataONE specific token for passing around between nodes / method calls
  - Evaluate PASTA approach for token content
  - Is SAML overkill, or is there to be a DataONE specific structure
  - Could also be a library that generates a token locally rather than a service
    - More scalable than relying a more centralized service

* Structure of authentication token
  * Principal identity
  * Time stamp
  * Authentication source / provider
  * Groups?

Example of PASTA Auth Token:
<authToken> 
    <userCredentials> 
        <userId type="distinguishedName">uid=mservilla,o=LTER,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</userId>
        <password encryption="AES">LJ7LKS(#NLS@VS56LK$</password>
        <roles>
             <role>ADMINISTRATOR</role>
             <role>INFORMATION MANAGER</role>
        </roles>
        <groups>
             <group>CLIMATE STUDY</group>
             <group>KBS</group>
        <groups>
    </userCredentials> 
    <ttl unit="seconds">90384592342</ttl> 
</authToken>

Need to define Groups in DataONE. (One advantage of a login service might be that it could populate a token with group membership information)

- May be able to collapse roles and groups into one 
- When are attributes injected into a certificate? At the cert request being sent to CILogon?
- Sequence diagram: https://repository.dataone.org/software/AuthNPrototype/trunk/CILogonAuthN.png

- Is CILogon able to inject any additional attributes into the certificate?
- What does the SAML assertion actually contain? (Ken Klingenstein's presnetation at the Fed Sec workshop had some examples)

- Could also lookup group information at the authorization stage - but this increases the number of service calls significantly

* Authorization
  * Rules to be expressed
  * Serialization of rules

Matt has been drafting some notes on this: http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/Authorization.html

- Can gain a lot of efficiency in authz checking by controlling at the service method call level

* Implementation approach
  * Current suggestion of four phases is perhaps too fragmented


2. Search and discovery discussion (Not covered during call - defer to next discussion)

* Query syntax that should be supported

  * Currently "SOLR"
  * CQL support?

* Introspection

  * List of fields and their types
  * Distinct terms for a field (and counts)

* Scaling search with authorization
