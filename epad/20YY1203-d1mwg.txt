Meeting Notes:
        Attending: John, Karthik, Jim, Jane, Greg, Nassib

To avoid my missing the first two meetings next year, we'll shift our
every-three-week schedule ahead one week, the next two meetings being

         Jan 7
         Jan 28

Progress has been slow.  We're blessed with a cool, exciting idea, but
we're unfunded and our end-of-the-year deadlines are approaching quickly.

Jane has put a number of things in our shared DataONE space [1].  This
includes meeting notes, All Hands meeting slides, poster (Angela, et al),
pre-prints and slides from ASIST/SIG/CR workshop of Oct 26.  We are asked
to share our minutes, presentations, activities that we pursue in this
space so that others writing reports have easy access to our output and
knowledge or our activities.

Jane has been talking to folks with mentoring gifts (eg, Paul Jones of
ibiblio [2] fame), about enlisting student help and wants us all to think
about (a) what a useful statement of work could look like and (b) places
where we might best try to recruit from.

Our charter includes a short group assessment component, which we'll
also need to think about early next year.

Everyone is asked to track mentions of our working group effort at a
eg, Nassib's Supercomputing conference presentation on Nov 14.  This
is a helpful metric of our activity for DataONE's quarterly reports.
Action item: I'll set up a shared document for this (eg, googledoc
or etherpad).

Action item: we need to schedule our next face-to-face meeting.
