Goals for year
--------------

- increase MNs
- diversify ITK tools
- get integration across DataNets


Agenda Topics
-------------

Next year's goals and projects
  -- improving discovery (e.g. semantics)
  -- data resuse and integration
    -- workflows, provenance, semantics
  -- supporting annotation
  -- supporting subscription/notification of change/new content
  -- design work on authorization, UIs for identity management
  -- content subsetting
  
  -- MN software stacks
  -- ITK work planning
    -- (e.g., Morpho, R, Kepler/VisTrails, MyExperiment)
    -- citation -- consistent representation, revise search results to show citation and contributors
    -- discuss other discovery mechanisms
        -- e.g., triplestore for all science metadata
  -- log reporting/usage statistics
  -- CN feature expansion
    -- replication!
    -- expanding search API (selecting fields, enumerating field values)
    -- split OneMercury onto different virtual machines
    -- access control on search
    -- auditing (process for content fixity checking)
    -- log aggregation and access control
        -- need verified email address for DAAC content access
    -- scalability -- sync is 2s/transaction
        -- profiling
  -- Discussion of change in policy re: immutability of identifiers requested by CDL


Agenda Outline
--------------

12 blocks (3 days, 4 blocks per day)

1. Review of progress, project schedule, feature prioritization,  API review, content change policy
2. Authentication, authorization
3. Log reporting, monitoring, metrics for sponsor reports
4. Discovery

5. Replication
6. Scalability, performance
7. MN software deployments, prioritization, support, software, MN services
8. MN software deployments, prioritization, support, software, MN services
