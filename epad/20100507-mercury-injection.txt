1) Need samples from of the Scimeta (and XML schema) and  Sysdata from KNB and Dryad
  a) Mercury injestion needs to know which elements of the Scimeta need to be indexed within Mercury
  b) extend mercury indexer configuration file to read in the EML (knb) so as to index 

2) Need to create a process to merge the 2 docs into one
  a) need to know where the Sysmeta data file is located that represents a SciMeta file
    1) method will receive a fullpath as parameter
  b) open SysMeta
  c) create XML Doc from SysMeta
  d) read the ID of the SciMeta doc from the  SysMeta file
    1) the Id of the SciMeta datafile in the SysMeta file will provide the filename of the SciMeta file: systemMetadata/identifier
  e) open file sciMeta using provided ID from SysMeta
  f) create a XML Document  (assuming wellformed xml) from Scimeta
  g) grab root element of scimeta
  h) create new node <mercury>
  i) attach SysMeta root node to mercury node
  j) attach mercury element as last child to root elemlent of scimeta document
  k) save off merged sci - sys meta doc into cn_dev/mercury_inst_datanet directory
