Roger
 * 20130920
   * Have ONEDrive working in Windows.
   * Working on Windows installer for ONEDrive.
 * 20130918
   * Done adding the Windows specific code paths to the CLI. The only real difference now is that command completion with tab doesn’t work in the Windows version. I think that is a "won't fix".
   * Added a page to the documentation that describes how to set up the CLI on a Windows machine (from PyPI) and make a stand alone installer for it. That page also describes how to install the CLI into an existing Python environment.
   * Found that the API changes in Foresite broke data_package in d1 client, and fixed that.
   * Decided to jump directly over to doing the same for ONEDrive, so that’s what I’m working with now.
   * Still waiting for KU to get the test certificate installed for their Member Node. Chris made the cert for them last week and they got back on Monday, I think it was, and said they would install it in the next couple of days.
 * 20130911
   * Have CLI working in Windows.
   * Still working on installer.
   * Waiting for CJ at KU to get back. He's looking into certificate installation for their new MN.

   * Working with CJ to get KU MN into final testing.

 * MN onboarding process guide
   * waiting for decision on where to put the overview document, whether to have 2 (high-level and mid-level) or combine into one and move mid-level content into detail pages.
