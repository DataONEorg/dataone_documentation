Possible Questions & Ideas for Specific Tools Assessment
Subgroup: Lei, Mike, Bob S. 


Funding Opportunities to NSF, COTS Vendors to make Tools available to DataONE and community.  Could help with sustainability and/or additional resources to development.  

Target Group: DataONE Current & Potential Member Nodes
Process: Send to MN, DataONE PI's, DUG Members
Process: Ask Receipants to send to "5-10" people in their organization who are practicing scientists.   
Sampling: request a mailing list from each MN of data depositors (and including data users / data downloaders, if possible). 

Survey administration: Survey is potentially long and repetitive; consider variants that focus in on a portion of the stages of the lifecycle instead of all.  Send Survey of 1st 4 phases of the data Life Cycle to x number of respondents and then send last 3 phases of the data life cycle to y number of respondents.   

Use USGS, LTER, Dryad for 1st 4 Phases.   Get DUG Members to send and sponsors
Use EVA, DAAC Users for the last 3 Phases of survey 
CUAHSI (ask Jeff if they're more front-side or back-side users; more integration?)
Merritt (preservation step; get information about librarian - curator toolsets)
NBII (focus on first 4 phases and data providers; perhaps also ask about last 3 phases)
TeraGrid (how can we target domain scientists using TeraGrid services? John Cobb help?)
South African National Parks
SAEON
USGS Science Base
USGS Publications Warehouse

Tools Assessment questions:
Design questions according to data life cycle stages?
Tools use: what, when, where, how, and why
Question technique: critical incident? Or from general to specific?
 
Potential questions:
1. use of familiar tools vs. use of unfamiliar tools (adopting new tools)
2. any established culture of tool use in specific discipline
3. satisfaction with current tool use
4. interest in providing tools information for the depositing of tools/methods
