ORC
===

- 130TB with RAID6 installed
- mounted drives only showing 500GB

VMWare limitations: file size limitation of 2TB

- one physical adapter connected to iSCSI (2 ports through switch to drive arrays)

- (perhaps) Need to reconfigure to see the full partition

- Need responsive admin support at ORC.

Action: DAVE - check with Bruce to try and get admin support a little more responsive

According to the documentation, here is the PCI slot configuration:

1 - PCIe slot 1 PCI Express (Generation 2) x8 link expansion slot (24.13 cm [9.5"] length).
2 - PCIe slot 2 PCI Express (Generation 2) x4 link expansion slot  (low-profile 24.13 cm [9.5"] maximum length, with a standard height  bracket).
3 - PCIe slot 3 PCI Express (Generation 2) x8 link expansion slot (low-profile 24.13 cm [9.5"] length).
4 - PCIe slot 4 PCI Express (Generation 2) x8 link expansion slot (low-profile 24.13 cm [9.5"] length).
5 - PCIe slot 5 PCI Express (Generation 2) x8 link expansion slot (24.13 cm [9.5"] length).
6 - PCIe slot 6 PCI Express (Generation 2) x8 link expansion slot (24.13 cm [9.5"] length).

The current dual-port iSCSI controller cards occupy slots 5 and 6.   Slots 1-4 are available, however they are all low profile except for  slot 1. Also, slot 2 is x4 where all the others are x8.

I don't know what form factor the 10G network cards are, but it looks  like slots 1, 5, and 6 are the only ones with x8 speed that will accept a  full height card.  It looks like slots 3 and 4 will be your only option  to keep the existing iSCSI cards and have 2 "like" 10G network cards (assuming they are available in low profile  versions).  If you want 4 connections to the iSCSI controllers as exist  now, then each card will need 2 10G ports.
