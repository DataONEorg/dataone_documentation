1a) Biva executes FPC1 in Taverna and publishes trace (Using Biva's tool).
1b) Biva would show some simple queries using the Collaboration Interface

2a) Anand downloads the data from SPS (Using Collaboration Interface), uses the data of Biva's FPC1, executes FPC2 in Kepler.
2b) Upload the trace of FPC2 and establishes the link
2c) Anand would show some other queries using the Collaboration Interface to express basic dependencis

3) Anand publishes the trace for FPC1.

4a) Saumen downloads the data from SPS (Using Collaboration Interface), uses the data of Anand's FPC1, executes FPC2 in CoMaD.
4b) Upload the trace of FPC2 and establishes the link
4c) Saumen would show some complex queries using the Collaboration Interface to express complete dependency graph

5a) Anand downloads the data from SPS (Using Collaboration Interface), uses the data of Anand's FPC1, executes FPC2 in Kepler.
5b) Upload the trace of FPC2 and establishes the link

6) Show very complex queries to show used_by relation from one run to multiple runs

Optional------

Multiple source single destination

7) Anand publishes the trace for FPC1.
8) Saumen publishes the trace for FPC1.

9a) Saumen downloads the data from SPS (Using Collaboration Interface), using one data from of Anand's FPC1 and another from Saumen's FPC1, executes FPC2 in CoMaD.
9b) Upload the trace of FPC2 and establishes the link

10) Show very complex queries to show generated_by relation from multiple runs to one run
