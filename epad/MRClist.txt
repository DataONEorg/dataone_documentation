Things we want to establish with MRC/Kris:

Communication
-how, when, and coordination (does this pertain to announcements of partnership?) -- no, more about how we 
-is there a private wiki or something for communications, project progress, timelines, etc?
    do you mean for CDL/UC internal communication? we can use our confluence site for that. for CDL/MRC, we didn't have much success with that last time. They aren't fans of Google docs or dropbox. They prefer sharepoint but can't seem to give us login privilages on their accounts.
-developer at SDSC is under supervision of Susan Borda


Work practices
1. New developer should be able to contact MRC developers directly
2. CDL gets credit on all materials, presentations, etc.
3. Main website for DataUp will be dataup.cdlib.org
4. MRC to continue paying for Azure

Outputs
1. All code open source on current bitbucket site

Questions:
1. Any money agreements? Is MRC paying for anything?
2. In cases of conflict, where does the final decision making power lie?
3. Does MRC have any expectations for us? 
        Meeting attendance
        check-ins
        presentations/conferences
4. Where will web application sit? Who will pay for it? (relates ro #4 under work practices)
5. Is there an SLA for maintenance etc? (Not sure if this should be in questions or work practices?)
6. clear explanation of who at MRC is working on DataUp; their plans for DataUp; our involvement with plans
