Breakout 2: Software Tools

Session 3 1300 - 1420

Presentation: ITK (Investigator ToolKit) Overview
ITK provides direct link for people that want to use the data, to access the data.  Some tools enable you to write data to DataONE. 
Basic concept: adapt a tool using one of the libraries to work with DataONE. 
Tools developed thus far have been through an iterative process. Has also been a process of prioritization (there are many tools out there used within the community, cannot adapt them all).

Which 3 tools do you most like to use for analysis / visualization?

DUG Surveys - 86 tools identified for data analysis

Audience response on 3 most desired tools:
ArcGIS (2) - arcpy
Excel (4)
Matlab (3)

DMPTool  http://dmptool.org
Comes in 2 parts - DMPTool1 and DMPTool2.  First iteration around for a couple of years.  2nd iteration under development on a new grant.
Designed to meet NSF and other requirements.  Supplies questions to walk people through a DMP as they are creating one.
Value add - integration with an institutional framework;  local guidance, resources etc.
https://dmp.cdlib.org/

>Brief step-by-step explanation of using the tool.
 
Careful not to say that the DMPTool does it for you.  Designed to make writing a DMP easier.
Focus of DMPTool is on simplifying and scaling the common parts.
DMPTool2 - funding from Sloan Foundation for tool development and one from IMLS for library educaiton and outreach.
2 advisory boards - researcher and administrative user.

New functionality within DMPTool2
For researchers ...
 * Include collaborators in plans
 * Share plans with specific group or with the public
 * Send plans to be reviewed
For admin users ...
 * Brand the tool
 * Create own requirements template
 * Add and edit resources through the interface
 * Require plans to be reviewed
 * Review plans - approve / request edits
 * Export all DMPs for data mining purposes

Timeline - functional development august 2013, api implementation september 2013, production release with documentation october 2013.

Questions for audience:
1) How often are you reusing a DMP that you created for a previous grant?
I used it only once to see how it works
Ditto, I used it once to explore, but have also demonstrated to students in ILS. (btw, not that it matters, bu tthis is jane g, i should be blue on the etherpad, but i'm showing yellow.)
Not grant writing right now so have used it only for demo / education purposes

2) How often would you use the tool in a year?
I used it only once to see how it works
couple of times - but not for its intended purpose

3) How important are guidance and local resources to your DMP creation process?
It helped a lot. I also used existing examples to see how people are doing it.
My sense is it's a good, grounded tool. I like the questions, and that it is general.  I see tremendous value in this, across multiple disciplines.
Very important

4) How often are you collaborating on the creation of a DMP?
I did not collaborate with it.
Not yet.
Would be nice to have some collaboration with national project that management data project in Biodiversity in Brazil (SISBIO - Ministry of Environment). 

5) How can we demonstrate benefit to the researcher from using the DMPTool?
Show that DMPTool DMPS are well received by funding agencies - stats, quotes, usecases (would be great if you could show that this is why the researcher got funding! :)).  Highlight the simplicity of the process vs interpreting funding guidelines. Highlight the multitude of support resources available.  Highlight the multiple funder requirements covered (although a researcher will likely only use a couple).
The general benfits of having a data management plan apply.  Have testimonials of folks confirming the benefits.


6) Should we put more emphasis on quality (i.e. guidance, workflow, templates etc) or quantity (i.e. number of institutions, user, plans etc)?
Former.
Quality is obviously important, but not to the point of perfection, where progress is stopped.  Is there an example hub?  A place where people can share examples?

Questions from audience...
Q: repository recommendations to users - what kinds of plans do you have for that?
A: bc the DMPTool covers a wide domain, the scope is quite large in doing that, but would like to.  
Q: maybe incorporate existing directories - e.g. databib?
A: yes, that would be something for a later development.  one of the team is affiliated with databib
Q: need to be mindful of a possible tension with institutions recommending their own repository.
Q: in brazil, although no push to have DMPs (from funding agency) thinking about using bitbucket code to develop the tool for brazil (in portugese)
A: have considered international versions


DataUp presentation (http://dataup.cdlib.org/)
DataUp an extension for MS Excel
MS Excel widely used.  65% of data in DataONE is in a form readable by Excel.

> Brief step-by-step explanation of the DataUp add-in

Questions from audience...
Q: Can you change the target repository from ONEShare to an institutional repository, for example.  Is this on the dev plan?
A: Can see the value in that but resources are limited.  The priority is in getting excel users to apply good management practices and upload / share the data.  As an open source project, people could go in and do that themselves.
Q: have you given thought to controlled vocab?
A: there is a little bit in there, pulling from EML.  Huge opportunity for more to be done.  on the list.
Q: do you have feedback on people that are using it and the quality of the metadata in there.
A: this analysis has not been done.
Comment: we have the potential for additional funds (NSF supplement, private foundation) to continue some of this work.

consider looking @  HIVE for DataUp (from jane)

ONEDrive
ONEDrive makes the download part of data acquisition trivial.  Can save queries into a workspace environment and can then retrieve that workspace description in ONEDrive which connects to DataONE as a drive mount, creating content that matches the query.

>Step-by-step explanation

Next Steps:
Three main focus areas.
 * Refine the content views
   * improve client side rendering of results
 * Enable online workspace management
   * integrate with ONEMercury
   * integrate with identity management
   * integrate with content use reporting
 * Augment search index (taxonomics, spatial etc)
   * utilize external services for lookups
   * improve feedback to other systems

Should be solid by next AHM (October 2013)

Questions from audience...
Q: Is it an online only working environment
A: At present it is but can be developed to 'download all'


ITK Next Steps
Need to get production versions of the tool
DMPTool out for a while
DataUp freshly out there with potential funds for new work
ONEDrive nearly out there.

Session 4 1440 - 1600

Notes from 2nd group (Group 1)

ITK - Investigator Toolkit


ITK - enable client tools to interact with a service interface to Member Nodes (MN) and Coordinating Nodes (CN) sits on top all repositories.

ITK - Gateway for researchers to get access to the content
category of services of ITK
 * data discovery
 * analysis, visualization
 * data management

Also includes java library, python library, CLI tools adn REST URLs

Lots of tools out there, but w/ limited resources have to prioritize. External assessments and DUG surveys helped shape which ones that were picked.

Audience gets to pick 3 tools that would like to work with DataONE. Exercise @ gets to write down on "sticky-do's".

These tools work across the datalife cycle. 

Today will talk about DMPTool, DATAup & ONEDrive

DMPTool
Start with current version DMPTool 1:
    free, workflow for creating a DMP help meets funder requirements, institutional integration via shibboleth and institutional context (pointing to local guidance, point to resources & staff)
    
Go to http://dmptool.org
Andrew giving a not-live demo

Sloan Funding for DMPTool2
to enhance current version
W/ DMPTool2 - There are 2 advisory groups: researcher advisory board & administrative user advisory board

New functionality:
for researchers: 
 * to include collaborators, 
 * share plans with specific groups or with public, 
 * send plans to be reviewed

for institutions:
 * branding the tool, 
 * create own requirements template (e.g. locally required DMP), 
 * add and edit resources through the interface, 
 * require plans to be reviewed, 
 * review plans - approve and request edits, 
 * export all DMPs for data mining purposes

Wireframes for DMPTool2

looking for use cases for API w/ DMPTool2

Questions:
1) How often are you reusing a DMP that you created for a previous grant?
I used it only once to see how it works



2) How often would you use the tool in a year?
I used it only once to see how it works
couple of times - but not for its intended purpose

3) How important are guidance and local resources to your DMP creation process?
It helped a lot. I also used existing examples to see how people are doing it.


4) How often are you collaborating on the creation of a DMP?



5) How can we demonstrate benefit to the researcher from using the DMPTool?
 


6)  Should we put more emphasis on quality (i.e. guidance, workflow,  templates etc) or quantity (i.e. number of institutions, user, plans  etc)?


quality more important that quantity


Q. Can you somehow capture institutional information to help capture local success rates, etc.? Asking some relevant questions to allow at least manual follow-up on funding success.

Use mining capability as a potential Graduate student project to compare plans and success rate. Is this from Mike Frame?  If yes, it'd be great to try and get a grad student project lined up to do this for this fall.  Could you help?

Q. Could some of the data generated by DMPTool be used to bootstrap MD for data collected by the project.

Q. Develop a utility to help develop a more detailed post-award DMP rather than the 2-pager requested by the funder.
A. DMPTool doesn't limit size. Smithsonian has an internal DMP requirement with ~ 79 questions. SI plans to add their own as one of the selectable templates.Data entry is more constrained to be macine actionable.

Q. Routing of a phased DMP within an organization is an emerging need with review and approval workflows.

Q. Taking advantage of DataBib and other services?
A. Potentially, we have an open call for use cases.

DataUp
Created because most  researchers use excel. Why not create a tool that will help researchers where they work.

DataUP Solution:
 * guide user to clean up spreadsheet
 * gather metadata describing spreadsheet
 * apply a unique id to spreaadsheet
 * upload to DataONE - ONEShare

2 versions of DataUp:
MS Excel (windows only) addon
Web interface

web version not as robust as MS Excel. Next version of DataUo will make the two comparable.

upload as either CSV or XLSX format. Each uploaded file gets a unique ID.

Current state - open source https://bitbucket.org/dataup

Recently awarded NSF suppliement
    correct & refine
    improve the web version (cross platform support)
    actively investigating further opportunities
    
Question from audience: will the next version support export into XML format?
Q: can I get a download of the file and not put it in a repo?

DataUP min. metadata are those EML fields that are required by EML


ONEDrive

ONEMercury is a seach portal.
has index of all memeber nodes

workspace defines network drive contents, queries and selected specific objects 

ONEDrive is connected as a network drive.

Next Steps:
Three main focus areas.
 * Refine the content views
   * improve client side rendering of results
 * Enable online workspace management
   * integrate with ONEMercury
   * integrate with identity management
   * integrate with content use reporting
 * Augment search index (taxonomics, spatial etc)
   * utilize external services for lookups
   * improve feedback to other systems

Should be ready by DataONE all-hands-meeting in October


Q: what is included in the ONEDrive "network drive"?
A: its the result (data & metadata)  of the query. the actual data is downloaded when "opened".

Q: what taxinomic name service will be used?
A: lots to choose from, but have not selected a specific one. should be easy to do, just haven't done it. Want to have just one to use in DataONE index, but which one to use is question.

Usability testing of ONEDrive - see Mary Beth West to get a quick Demo and feedback.

Q: is there an issue tracking system?
A: Using Redmine for member nodes and other question
Dave has a simple page. http://redmine.dataone.org
