From Chris:  
The workshop at NCEAS was very much a hands on activity where we walked through the process of installing Metacat on virtual machines. This required extensive preparation - we built something like 12 VMs that were all setup ready for metacat install (dependencies etc), and walked through the install button clicking. This required a VM host and consistent user environment for accessing the VMs which could be done at NCEAS, but would be challenging at an independent location.

Overall, I felt that workshop was good, but didn't really provide much for folks to take home, since they'd be looking at the install directions anyway when installing Metacat, and the hard part is actually getting the environment setup for the install.

I suspect we could provide a very effective experience through a combination of presentations and discussion about the process for MN setup for a couple of specific examples. Amber and I talked on this a bit yesterday, and one thing that may work well is to do a simple survey of attendees - basically why they are interested, the types of data they are working with, their existing repository solutions, needs for a new solution and so forth. Out of that, I expect we could get a couple of scenarios that we could step through basically what it would take to get setup, and this would be basically working through the MN documentation / installation workflow, and nailing down a few of the particularly challenging aspects (e.g. certificates). This would, I expect, get folks up to speed on the big picture and sufficient detail so they could more efficiently work through a real installation in their environment.

So the agenda might look something like (assuming four segments to the day):

1. Overview of DataONE, all the pieces, how things work, metadata standards, investigator tools.

2. Big picture step through of MN installation process, tailoring it a bit to align with a couple of scenarios drawn from the survey material.

3. Focussing on details about some of the steps and some of the operational requirements such as immutability

4. More details as necessary on difficult topics such as certificates and identity management, supporting different metadata formats, dealing with changing content over time.

Does that seem reasonable to everyone? The overall goal would be that folks would leave having a pretty good understanding of what it takes to get a Member Node setup, and a good general understanding of DataONE and it overall goals.

This is of course all just a suggestion for discussion.

Pre-work -- need to survey the intended participants for what they want out of the workshop, and what they're looking for from DataONE.

Pre-work - check table arrangements and request classroom if not too late

Send out intro video before the workshop (maybe with the survey). Have as a link at the end of the survey so it doesn't bias our survey :)

Frame agenda (at least intro) to use the information that's presented on the web site for becoming a member node -- we have an established vocabulary, let's make sure that we use that.  http://www.dataone.org/member-node-deployment-process and the other, higher level stuff.

Discussion of types of member node stacks, how to select a stack.

Comments about certificates
