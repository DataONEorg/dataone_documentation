getLogRecords access restriction behavior
===============================

v1.0:
~~~~
access restriction - not uniformly implemented.  metacat




LogEntry objects contain sensitive information, such as ip address and user name, that should not be freely available, even though getLogRecords is a MN Tier1 method. Member nodes can either deny access to non-CN callers - returning NotAuthorized in those cases - or redact the sensitive information based on the identity of the caller.

For example, subjectA might only get Log records where she is the rightsHolder (and/or has changePermission), or get all the Log records, but have the IP address and user fields redacted.  

It is recommended that Tier1 member nodes configure this method so that only the CNs in the envrionment can access it.

Higher tiered MNs should compare the client subject against the NodeList (cn.listNodes())



Testing getLogRecords:

valid returns when client has no certificate or is not a CN:
1)  NotAuthorized
2)  redacted LogRecords  / anonymized LogRecords - fake IP addresses that allow aggregation - fake userIDs that allow aggregation

valid returns when client is CN (or admin).
1) Log object
->  can now test parameters are working as expected.

What is the proper exception when MN can't get a nodelist from the CN?
(stale or null nodelist, and CN not responding).
How to test?

Tests are:  

1) testGetLogRecords_security()
  - what do I look for in the Log
