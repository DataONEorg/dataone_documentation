8. How long have you been aware of your library's RDR policies? Indicate year. –I was hoping that this was covered already by the ARL E-science survey, but I re-read that survey and they never ask any questions about how long has the library had policies. This may be a question to throw out because 1) individuals from the same insitute would likely give different years to this question and 2) we may not gain much are we really concerned with this? This survey is about baseline data for the year 2010, not the past-BG
 
 
Opportunities for Engagement
9. Critical incident questions. Suzie will provide to me some surveys with examples of this style of question. (BG)
 
Barriers to Engagement
 
10. The following group of statements asks you about reasons for participating and for not participating in research data-related services and activities (RDR). Tell us how much you agree with each statement using the following scale: agree strongly, agree somewhat, neither agree nor disagree, disagree somewhat, disagree strongly. 
 
My library does not have adequate funding
I have the necessary skills, knowledge, training
My patrons do not need these services and activities
My library has sufficient technical infrastructure to support RDR
I have access to graduate or continuing education courses to get  training in RDR services to meet patron’s needs
RDR  is just as important as other activities that I provide for my patrons
I can’t obtain adequate training through on-the-job training and in-house professional development
My job allows me sufficient time to provide RDR for my patrons
I do not have sufficient subject expertise (e.g., phsycial science; social science, etc.) to help my patrons 
RDR is not a priority at my library
 
Importance of and Motivation for Engagement 
 
11.Thinking of your involvement in RDR activities, how would you describe your level of engagement? –Too vague of a question. Either “how satisfied are you with your current level of involvement in RDR activities”: use below scale or “How would you describe your current level of engagement in RDR”: too high, not enough, etc.-BG
 
very satisfied
satisfied
neither
dissatisfied
very dissatisfied
 
12a. What, if anything, is the most important motivation for your involvement in RDR? 
Open statement:                                  (skips to #13)
I am not currently involved in RDR (skips to #12b)
 
12b. What would most motivate you to become involved in RDR? 
 
 
13. The following group of statements relates to your opinion on librarian involvement in research data-related services and activities (RDR). Tell us how much you agree with each statement using the following scale: agree strongly, agree somewhat, neither agree/nor disagree, disagree somewhat, disagree strongly, don’t know
 
Libraries need to offer RDR services to remain relevant
The library will see decreased funding if it does not offer RDR services
Losing data / data sets jeopardizes future scholarship 
Librarians should be stewards of all types of scholarship, including data sets
Researchers at my institution will be at a competitive disadvantage when competing for grants if the library does not provide RDR services 
Providing RDR services will improve the impact of our institutional outputs
RDR is an unnecessary service for librarians to provide to their patrons
The library is the best-suited entity at my institution to provide RDR
Providing RDR increases a library’s prestige
Without RDR provided by a library, graduates will be data illiterate
Decentralized, departmental or college RDR services will result in suboptimal stewardship
 
 
14. Do you have any other thoughts or comments about RDR services? [open-ended question]
