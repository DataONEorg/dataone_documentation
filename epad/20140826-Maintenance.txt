Maintenance Discussion


Things to maintain (and minor/evolutionary enhancements):

- CN Infrastructure

      - Dublin core support for MPC (qualifieddc)
        - https://dataone-test.pop.umn.edu/mn/v1/node
      - Replica auditing (periodic verification of replicas, dev complete)
      - Libclient connection management (defer to version 2.0)
      - Log Aggregation bug (defer)
      - Mercury UI (complete)

      - 

  - 2.0 Release

- Member Node software stacks
  - GMN (Dave/Mark)
  - Metacat (Jing/Chris/Ben?/Matt)

  - R plugin
      - Matt and ROpenSci?
  - Libclient (java, python)
      - Maintenance team
  - CLI
      - Maintenance team
  - Morpho
      - Needs release; thus needs resolution of authn issues
  - ONEDrive
  - ONEMercury
      - Maintenance team, usability team
  - "Metacat UI" search interface
      - Can be pointed to production now, see test data at https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu 
          - not production, looks like test data

- Documentation (primarily to ensure docs are available, and to provide docs for procedures, operations activities)
    - Architecture 
    - Operations
    - ask.dataone.org? (all on the project)
- Hardware
- Other 
    * redmine, subversion, git, git, (emphasize other areas), Splunk, Nagios, etherpad

Clarification: Tasks associated with routine MN onboarding are primarily covered within MN Wrangling.  Goal: keep MNW's as self-sufficient as possible and have a couple people as key bridges between the MNW and maintenace and development teams.  Use ticket system (redmine) for tracking maintenance-related MN onboarding tasks.

MN onboarding support: new formats, new indexing rules will need support from Maintenance group
what  about certs? (will there be someone on the MNW who can do certs, or  will we need to have help from someone on maintenance team?)
