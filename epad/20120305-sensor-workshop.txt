Installation prerequisites
Each lab machine will have:
 * Windows 7, with admin privileges
 * Java 6
 * Microsoft SQL Server (2005 or 2008 - prefer 2008 with mixed mode authentication enabled)
 * MySQL
 * CUAHSI HIS - ODM Data Loader, Streaming Data Loader, and ODM Tools
 * SVN 1.6 or greater
 * Ant 1.7.1 or greater
 * Kepler
 * R (linked to Kepler - path set)
 * Sample Campbell .dat file that is subset of NTL. (Jeff)
 * Can we have access to one of the machines or an image of one of the machines so we can test our exercises before showing up?
