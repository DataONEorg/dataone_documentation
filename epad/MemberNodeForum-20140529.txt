Agenda:

0. Welcome new attendees - introductions: 

1. Network-wide update and issues affecting MN's as a whole
 * CN issue (tidy process) - complete (yay!), everything seems to be back to normal, CDL looks to be ok now (they had some issues after the heartbleed mess)

 * New MNs coming soon:  EDAC (Earth Data Analysis Center) and LTER-Europe

 * New current member nodes page (aka "the dashboard")

2. Open issues:  MNs please add anything you would like to address here.
 * MN Operations documentation - on hold

Lisa Stillwell at RENCI will have a list of questions and next steps (good use of documentation).  Next step will be testing either against a specific iRODS instance or all of DFC.  (Bruce)

3. Feature requests/opportunities for collaboration:
 

    
4. MN showcase:  Member Nodes who are present, please discuss your status:
NKN (Ed) - we've been loading data into our new repository system, have a need to develop a set of checksums and identifiers for data, generated and in a database after this past weekend; plan to flag items in database to help build resource maps, get this data into DataONE; have metadata (ISO19115-2), need to build resource maps and plan to get metadata/data into the sandbox MN; using the Python client library.  Working on this afternoon.  (Roger is CCIT POC).

PISCO (Mike) - tidy process cleaned up all PISCO's problems (woo hoo!), now can move on to solr query processes.  

GLEON (Corinna) - (Laura had sent an email to Corinna re: approach to deployment), Corinna will need to get with other folks; solr query thing go stalled, (I think Corinna is by herself right now)  GLEON meeting is in October in Quebec, Canada; Corinna would like for someone from DataONE to come and present and help folks get data in the GLEON MN.  Dave to help Corinna get things running for this effort.

If you have any other comments/suggestions about anything discussed here, please feel free to post to developers@dataone.org.
