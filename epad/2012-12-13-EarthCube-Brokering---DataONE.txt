Agenda
1.  Introduction:  Goal is to initiate discussions about possible CI collaborations between DataONE and EarthCube Brokering
     - Discovery & Access Brokering is being used for the GEO System of Systems, in addition to EarthCube
2.  description of DataONE CI (Dave Vieglais, Matt Jones) 15 minutes
  - DataONE architecture docs: http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/index.html
  - service oriented architecture, with distributed content (Member Nodes)
  - standard APIs that provide communication between Member Nodes
  - Coordinating Nodes (three currently):  keep track of content among Member Nodes, along with replication
  - security and authentication
  - metadata harvested and indexed; used by search interface (ONEMercury) and API
  - able to harvest a number of different scienc metadata formats; DataONE has mapping from each standard into the DataONE required metadata
  - investigator tool kit-- common tools that have been adapted for the DataONE API
          - Python library and command line tool
          - R plugin:  R code can be used directly with DataONE API
  - currently have ~6 Member Nodes and have another dozen in development 
  - provenance tracking, search capabilities are being enhanced
  - DataONE does not have ability to search / access outside of the current Member Nodes
  - new Member Nodes are identified through DataONE User Group and also self-identified
  
  DataONE is one of the DataNET projects; other DataNET projects have come on-line in the past year or so

3..  description of EarthCube Brokering (Stefano Nativi / Mattia) (10 minutes)
 * http://www.eurogeoss.eu
 * Interoperability arrangements via a service bus
   * metadata models, data models, encoding formats, vocabs
   * protocols: discovery, access, viz, etc
   * sets of heterogeneous CIs, each using its own service bus
 * Each system implements it's own service bus
 * Developed 3rd party components that implement each service bus in the brokering infrastructure framework
   * either on the client or on the service provider side
 * SOA - Brokering approach
   * Users
   * Producers
   * Registry
   * Client apps need to know about diverse interfaces
 * service consumer <-- broker (+registry) --> service provider
 * Complexity moved from client&producer sides to middleware&cyber-infrastructure
 * Allows Network of Networks
   * no need for federal specs
   * low entry barrier
   * multidisciplinary
 * New capabilities
   * semantic discovery, data access, qa/qc, etc. other services
 * Facilitates sustainability
 * Brokering Framework
   * Discovery Broker (CSW/OpenSearch/OAI-PMH, etc) + Web 2.0 Resources
   * Semantic Broker (augments Discovery Broker through OpenSearch SPARQL)
   * Access Broker
     * problems: different services, formats, CRS, resolution, etc.
     * broker invokes transformation services to enable interoperability at the data level
 * GEO Web Portal
   * provides access to catalogs

 * current brokering focus is on geospatial data 

4.  discussion on collaboration between EarthCube Brokering and DataONE CI
 * long-term data preservation (DataONE)
 * benefit would be to make the DataONE data (heterogeneous ecological / field data) accessible through brokering
 * access broker could obtain a data object (e.g., geoTIFF) and modify (subset, mosaic, reproject, reformat, change resolution, etc.) based on the user request
 * Peformance and scalability. Brokering framework is cloud-based (e.g. Amazon cloud)
 * Access-control for the brokering services. not available at this moment. brokering is now focusing on open and freely available data
 * How the identification is achieved across distributed systems? Brokering framework relies on data providers for data preservation, identification, and other data management acitivies. Brokering framework provides a nice complementary layer for existing systems like DataONE CI.

next steps:
 * Brokering needs to test DataONE API and some data resources.
   * CSW interface or similar discovery interface
   * Brokering is Java-based. DataONE provides Java library. DataONE API provides lower-level capabilities than ONE Mercury user search interface (e.g. identifier retrieval, resolving identifier across member nodes, ...)
   * 
 * API to access DataONE Member Nodes:
   * http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/MN_APIs.html
 * API to access DataONE Coordinating Nodes
   * http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/CN_APIs.html
 * To understand DataONE messaging and object types:
   * http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/Types.html
 * Java common library (type definitions etc): https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_common_java/
 * Java client library: https://repository.dataone.org/software/cicore/trunk/d1_libclient_java/
 * Questions: log into IRC:  irc.ecoinformatics.org, channel #dataone
 * DataONE discovery & access demonstration science scenarios (DataONE ProvWG is working on several scientific workflows focusing on climate modeling inter-comparison by involving discovery&access&publish capabilities provided by DataONE)
