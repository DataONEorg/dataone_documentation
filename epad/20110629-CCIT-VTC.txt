Agenda
------


1. Preparations for the CCIT meeting coming up July 19-21

- Hotel reservations, travel

- Agenda for meeting

Tuesday

 * Review of current cyber infrastructure design, goals, implementation status.

- preservation angle - difference between checksums that apply to landing pages vs data sets
  - citation for an ORNL DAAC data product -> page with a bunch of links -> follow through to actual data
- Bruce - computing checksum of something that is actually the data, but DOI reslves to a page about the data - dataone identifiers could resolve to the actual files that make up the data
- need to clarify what the identifiers actually refer to
- at a citation level - do we care about the files or the ogc web service exposing those files

- A lot of citation practices are actually citing landing pages
- is a landing page more equivalent to a sciencemetadata document or some sort of packaging document providing reference to other pieces of a data set

- How to deal with time series data - what are the best practices for archiving this type of content, and how should DataONE deal with it.

- How do deal with changes in member node participation (e.g. some going offline or having reduced resources)?


Wednesday

 * Detailed scheduling and prioritization for the remainder of 2011. Identifying milestones and activities that need to include collaboration with other groups.
