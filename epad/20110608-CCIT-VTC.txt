CCIT Call - 2011-06-08
======================

Attendees: Dave Vieglais, Bob Sandusky, John Kunze,
Roger Dahl, Rob Nahf, Nick Dexter, Robert Waltz, Mark Servilla, Ben Leinfelder

Agenda
------

1. General update on CI development

  - Completing the refactoring to tiers
  - General cleanup in Metacat for dependencies on DataONE functionality
  - Stubbed out methods for authentication and access control
  - Refactoring test environment to support different modes of operation (e.g. as full integration suite, for development testing, and for exercising MN implementations)
  - Progressing on TeraGrid integration, stalled by DataONE buildout
  - State of different MN implementations
  
  - Giri: mercury code change - enables mercury instances as member nodes.
    - basic methods implemented, Jim has a few questions
    
  - John K - planning to start impl after DUG
  

2. Implementation of Identity Management infrastructure

- How to deploy CN identity service for a mix of development/integration/production environments
  - including CILogon
  - who has accounts in what environments? Need some sort of bootstrapping mechanism for setting up test accounts.
  - possible automatic conversion of accounts, such as from the NCEAS LDAP service. Works for the affiliated trees.
  - Mark: InCommon setup for LTER
  - Issues with web browser requirement for authentication against CILogon
  - Potential issue with DNs being stored in DataONE LDAP service, since DataONE does not represent the original LDAP trees. Potential for namespace collisions.
  

- How to deploy and configure LDAP replication nodes
  - includes sensitive (username/password) configuration
  - flexibly redefine the topology as servers come and go

- How closely to tie the CN identity service to the LDAP store on the same node
  - assumption is that each CN has an LDAP server on it
  - each LDAP replicates with others (independently of other CN replication tasks)
  - CN certainly could interact with other LDAP servers on different nodes, but when would that be needed?

3. Preparations for CCIT meeting in July
- Travel arrangements?
- Hotel confirmations?
- Draft agenda

  Day 1: Review of architecture, infrastructure, services in place
  Day 2: Recomendations for changes, prioritization, scheduling for release
  Day 3: Post release development, milestones, targets. Overlap with semantics group.

4. New file sharing tool to evaluate (experimental dropbox style based on Git)

   http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/tools/sparkleshare.html

  - Pluggable architecture offers some potential to act as an interface to DataONE, e.g. subscribe to a facet / query


5. Around the room


EVO Comments:

Mark Servilla: we've used EVO to record sessions and post them after the fact, which many users like the ability to view the session at a later date.  Echo tolerable compared to other technologies.

Bob S: echo when speakers other than Dave had the mic. People are still understandable.

John K: I hear my own voice echoing (I have a headset), as well as Roger and Rob and Mark, but not Dave

Roger: I'm hearing echo when people other than Dave are talking...

Robert: usually works well, but very buggy for me today.
