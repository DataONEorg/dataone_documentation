2.      May meeting (Miriam)
Meeting dates April 30 - May 2, travel April 29 and May 3.  Field trip on afternoon of May 2.  Knoxville, TN.  Travel and hotel arrangements in January 2013.
 
 
3.      Usability Update (Mary Beth)

Call with CCIT in October.  Chris Jones created Redmine tickets for all identified issues.  UPdates to system to be released in January 2013.  We should get mock ups to review to ensure that updates meet the needs identified.

- Demos at EAB at ONE Drive, 
- Usability testing of OneDrive in Spring 

- Idea of doing pre-testing instead of testing once systems have been developed.  Dave Vieglas also wants UA to get more involved in upfront development.  CCIT is trying to take initial UA ideas on future interface and do some mock up.s.  Mike to check in on this next week.  This will be a big topic in May.  


We will also work on Help topics once the mock ups are done.

Possibility to discuss is whether MNs would be interested in UA services for their own systems and interfaces.  This could be a fee for service possibility, with free services for minor/initial issues.  Opens up a possible sustainability thread. 

 ****Think about ahead of May meeting our own/UAWG Sustainability.  How can we sustain our own model?

4.      Assessments Update (Carol)

a.  Baseline Assessments with data collected, analysis and writing in process

- academic libraries completed, report is up on ACRL website.  
- IFLA paper and presentation and will be in their journal, also academic libraries/librarians.
- next step is to get our data publicly available.  LT/Todd Vision will host the data on Dryad.  Ben will work on this.
- Federal libraries/librarians (Carol Hoover/Miriam Blake) looking at the SLA summer poster session.  This is a good venue partly due to low resposne rate, we will work towards a follow up for a larger response.
- Data managers (Ellie/ Maribeth) - will be working on this after first of year. Get lit review done by grad students to Elllie/Maribeth.
- Data managers (Ben/Suzie A.) - comparing academic vs. gov respondents.  
- Data managers follow up survey via Ben Birch's dissertation re how data managers are involved in data life cycle.  This will be the follow up for data managers.

b.  Preparing for follow up assessment
- Scientists/educators:  survey is currently too long.  Miriam, Ben and Carol T will be reviewing and revising too shorten to essential information (January).  will use same distribution method from the original.  Pilot late January.  Goal is to get it out in February.  

c.  New assessments from AHM 2012
-  Early adopter/fig share:  Figshare said they were interested and would follow up but that has been slow.  Carol T will follow up with them again.  
- state libraries - Carol T will be in touch with Peggy.  
- publishers
- students - try to include in scientists/educators follow up

 6. Other project updates (all)
  - USGS is trying to do a repeat of the scientists assessments within USGS to tie to some of their internal measures, but questions and timing will be very similar to DataONE assessment.
  Ben to send current DataONE versioni to both Mike and Lisa Zolly.

 -------------------
notes:
Carol on sabbatical starting Dec. 15 - August 2013.  Carol will not attend the May meeting.  Miriam D and Ben will lead the assessments subgroup at that meeting

? re using summer internships to look at data usage/logs/visualization.  Bruce Grant will co supervise and other supervisors who would be good would be Skye Roseboom from CCIT and maybe Alison.  We should put this idea in when the call for summer interns is made.  Need to ask Alison re supervision (she is not on this call)

schedule next call for March/April in January.
