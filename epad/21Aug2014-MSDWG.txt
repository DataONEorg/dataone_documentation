The Fourth Plenary is coming closer and this edition we are offering all WG, IG & BoFs a permanent poster space to display your activities - this is called the RDA Marketplace. This means that you will have a poster board with your group name on it in the networking area of the plenary meeting over the 2,5 days. A part from the networking opportunities during the coffee & lunch breaks, we are organising 2 networking cocktails on Monday & Tuesday evening that will give you increased opportunity to display the group activities and recruit new members, adopters etc.
In order for us to organise this, we will use the official group name, logo & email address and we ask you to provide bySept 1st the following information:**** due date
Please adhere to the space guidelines:
Group description: 2 lines on what the group is all about (this is where you "sell" the group)
Goals: 6 lines / bullets on what the group goals are
Outcomes: 6 lines / bullets on what the group outcomes will be & what benefits they bring
Who?: 4 lines on the type of RDA members you encourage to join the group & what they should bring to the group
Please do not hesitate to contact either Timea or I on this and please make sure to deliver the required information by Monday Sept 1st @ 00:00 CET
