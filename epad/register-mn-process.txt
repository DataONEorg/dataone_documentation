Registering a Member Node

( http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/NodeIdentity.html )

-1. Decide on Node ID, other properties for node registration document

- node name shows up in Mercury search UI - so needs to be meaningful

0. Decide on environment for testing

1. Verify operation
(esp. for replication node

1.5 Register user account using CILogon identity
1.6 Approve user account (set as verified)

2. Add to node registry
  API call from MN to CN
  
  There needs to be some alert mechanism here to notify an administrator that a node has been registered. e.g. Email by node operator to "sys admin"


3. Approve node registration



Q. What happens when node information is incorrect before approval? 
A. Delete the entry, correct, and re-register

Q. How to manage test instances coming up and down and scrubbing content in test environment related to the test MN instance?
A. wing it





Approving a Node Registration
-----------------------------

Issue from the command line a curl get with production certs (if https connect) to ensure that they have a valid server certificate and that they recognize our server certificate

You can review all member nodes by executing the command on the CN::

  ldapsearch -x -W -D cn=admin,dc=dataone,dc=org -W -H ldap://localhost:389 -b 'dc=org' 'd1NodeType=mn'


You can review all the content related to a new node id with the command::

  ldapsearch -x -W -D cn=admin,dc=dataone,dc=org -W -H ldap://localhost:389 -b 'dc=org' 'd1NodeId=NODEID'


If the node structure looks good, then you will need to approve the node::

  /usr/local/bin/dataone-approve-node

you will be prompted with a list of nodes that are unapproved

Type in the number of node to approve.

Verify that the selection is correct

and you're done.
