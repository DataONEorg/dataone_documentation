Developers Call - 20111005
==========================

:Attendees: Rob, Matt, Chris, Bob S., Ryan, Nick,  Bruce, John K., Robert, Dave

Conference URL: https://ornl.webex.com/ornl/j.php?ED=182582897&UID=499263062&PW=NNzgyNWZjMThl&RT=MiMxMQ%3D%3D

Agenda
------

1. Quick CI update and summary from Implementors Workshop held last week in Santa Barbara

- CNs. Development CNs have sync (ok, bug fixes almost in place), replication working (almost). 

Indexing currently crude but functional. Service interfaces operational.

- MNs. Metacat, GMN good shape. Web Tester available at:

  http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080/MNWebTester

  Additional tests and capabilities are being progressively added as they
  become available. Tests are shared with the integration tests of the
  continuous build environment.
  
  - need to remove the example URLs form the test page

  - Merrit MN - some issues getting the datasets exposed. Will be running tests to verify operations.

- Clients

  Command line client in Python works OK, though is definitely not an end-user
  tool (good for developers).
  
  R client reads fine. Auth pieces in place, need to add support for resource maps. Add convenience methods to lib_client for getting the documented and documentedBy targets.

- Hardware - general target of about 3-4 weeks to start deploying CNs
  - UCSB about 70% installed
  - UNM - 
  - ORNL - vmware licenses available
     - Need netid for Dave, Nick, Matt for accessing console
  - Nick B or Bruce will draft doc describing the storage config


2. Preparations for the AHM

Website content. Some documents need to be written and made available for
  addition to the web site (www.dataone.org).
Bruce: I'll take the lead on this.  My plan is to put the files in https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/public_website/documents/2011-10-redesign-ccit-content/ as they get developed.  I'll write in HTML, but without any real styling, which will get handled by the CSS in the Drupal site.  
  
Data>Citing Data and DataONE
- Citation information for data derived from DataONE searches

Data>Contribute Data
- Description of how to contribute data to DataONE.  May also choose to link to some best practices.

Data>Find Data
- Landing page with information about the ONEMercury search software.  This will provide info in advance of public release and a landing page when coming back form the CN ONEMercury page.  Clicking on ONEMercury takes you to the mirror webpage hosted on the CNs being developed by Giri.  BEW: Some revision proposed here.  ONEMercury is a search interface and the one we'll have at this point.  Amber and I proposed to rename this as Find data, and would be a landing page with information about how to find data.

Data>Workflow Integration
- ?? Link also to pertinent Software Tools and Best Practices?  BEW: This should describe the ways that DataONE supports the scientific process and the use of a workflow to enable scientific reproducibility.  It goes beyond, but does include links to workflow software.

Products>Investigator Toolkit
Page about what the Toolkit is and with links to the toolkit elements.  


Tuesday afternoon "hands on" activities. Goals were to have ONEMercury
  (mercury on CNs), Zotero / Mendeley (using coins tags exposed by Mercury
  UI), R-plugin, and ONEDrive (the FUSE + Dokan file system driver).
  
  Status of these:
  
  - Mercury: Available as pilot, disconnected from the CNs. Issues are: 

    - Code provided for Mercury is not a complete project project and several
      dependencies need to be updated.

    - SOLR index is currently presenting an incomplete list of fields for
      Mercury. Updates are in progress, with rough values fairly straight
      forward to make available

    - Integration with CN services is incomplete. The changes necessary should
      be fairly straight forward and can be completed quickly once a stable
      build environment is available

  - Zotero / Mendeley: Dependent on fields from the SOLR index. These are
    being populated, so tags can be generated once the Mercury UI is available
    and operational on the CNs. Two fallbacks - a) rely on content in the
    pilot catalog for demonstrations. b) Setup coins tags on the testing
    search interface.
    
    Lead: Perhaps Giri? + (Miriam, 
    

    Merge this with Mercury

  - R: Read OK, write status - being worked on. Demonstration will likely be
    quite simple (read and write data - perhaps data packages as well if
    resource map parsing functionality is available) and command line
    oriented. 

    Read should be available, perhaps have the packaging available.
    Lead: Matt for half, Chris for the other half, Bob S for observations


  - ONEDrive: In the process of being updated to align with changes to the
    python common and client lib. Basic functionality will be available, as
    viewed at the review way back in February. Dokan version for Windows
    should be available. Data package presentation is dependent on OAI-ORE
    resource map documents being available for all data packages, otherwise
    just individual granules can be shown.

    Lead: Dave, Ryan
    Work to be done on representing packages.
    Important to show interaction with desktop apps.


  - CILogon work flow should replace the Zotero / mendeley part. This would be a nice hands-on session since all that is required is a web browser.
    Lead: Ben, Bruce

Important to have a community person involved with observations.

  
Wednesday Schedule

  - Preparations for public release. Scope, date, schedule, assistance for
    component review, testing.


Thursday Schedule

  - Major goals for 2012 - 2014:

    - Improving discovery
    - Additional MNs
    - Data services
    - Larger systems integrations (TG, USGS ScienceBase, etc)
