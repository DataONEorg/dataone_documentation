Agenda: 

        1. High profile issues (or current items of interest)
        
                CN fix?  in process, will announce when complete
        
                MN Dashboard - meeting 3/31/14, follow-up 4/2/14, sharing with MNF  4/3/14 with note sent to MN POCs (mnforum distribution)
                
                EDAC and LTER-Europe are ready to go, but we are going to hold off until after the CN fix is complete
        
        1.5   Current MNs
                Need MN desc docs for ESA and SANParks.  
       * In conversation with Judith Botha at SANParks.  
       * Matt says ESA likely will not be a MN in future, as they want to transition to keeping their data at Dryad.  For consistency, I'd like to have a MNDD from them, especially since we don't know how long it will be before they make the transition to Dryad.
                
        2. Status of upcoming MNs
