Must be done:
- Three member nodes - dryad, daac, and knb
- Member node integration testing
- CN integration testing
- Three coordinating nodes up
  - CN packages to deploy
  - VMs to be ready to receive CN packages
- CN replication
- documentation, presentations, demonstrations


Should be done:
- Testing the mercury indexer
- Completing command line client (python or java)
- Completing the R client 
- Automating the harvest of content from member nodes by CNs

- Add recommendation for date rendering



#332 - Dave - move to next sprint and flesh out tasks

#429 - MN integration testing.  Needs further discussion (chad and dave), move to sprint 10.

#609 (rpw add to sprint 10) Design and implement the  scheduler for synchronization service component
#658 - (rpw move to sprint 10) Create a watcher for the logs to handle replicate and create messages on the CN
#662 - (rpw move to sprint 10) Modify the harvester to read and update the registry information
#663 - (rpw move to sprint 10) Utilize a simple objectFormat registry to determine which configuration to feed the Mercury indexer
#664 - (rpw move to sprint 10) Implement CN_crud.resolve  method
#666 - 

#680 - move to next sprint
#681 -
#682 - move to next sprint - dependent on a few fixes to Metacat, and rebuilding the packages

#683 - dependent on #682 + #429
#684 - dependent on #683
#685 - could be as simple as running the db clean script, but need to extend at some point to completely nuke metacat for a clean install
#686 depends on #683

#688 - should be done today, otherwise move to sprint 10
#689 - depends on #688
#690 - waiting on next version of the indexer with debug output - sprint 10
#691 - change owner to Rob, move to sprint 10

#693, 694, 695 - move to sprint 10

#277, 291 - tests need to be updated

#618 - move to backlog, not really required for prototype

#677 - harvester is remaining item
- may be a task for pulling usage infomration from the mercury mysql database for the DataONE logs

#698 - should be fixed now, move to sprint 10

#702 - move to backlog, requires research on best library for doing this

#703 - Move to next sprint if not done before.
