Feb. 2011 DataNet review
5 page exec summary
15 page document
PMP, architecture, etc as appendices
Presentations with strong CI emphasis, demos

Timeline for Feb. 2001 DataNet review preparations
Nov. 4: document TOC
Jan 17: drafts for EAB review
Feb 7: final copies of docs to NSF
Feb 23-24: DataONE presentation and QA

Questions and comments on the NSF document outline:
C. Matt: tasks w/in CI need to be parsed out to other WGs
Q. Line: What does "work this into the dialog" mean? Activities and contribs of WGs will be woven into other sections, not as standalone WG sections
C. Randy: emphasize that DataONE is leveraging existing technologies and projects and not reinventing the wheel in terms of many CI functions
C. Dave: creating this document will serve our project well in addition to serving NSFs need, particularly in advance of the public release
Q. John C: how can the rest of us help? Dave, Matt and Bruce can coordinate volunteers and delegated tasks.

Discussion of the agenda:
Matt: rearrange parallel sessions; move A&A discussion sooner in the agenda so it doesn't get skipped. The revised agenda follows:

=============

Review Document Outline

* CI - Dave,Bruce,Matt (Note: As John notes, CI is an overloaded term that
  means many things to different people. Need to make sure that this section
  covers that entire waterfront so that reviewers will see their definition of
  CI)
  * Design, reference architecture diagrams (Bruce - diagrams, following ESDIS)
  * Usage scenarios that refer back to the architecture diagrams

(We have - system diagrams + software diagrams. 
Perhaps useful to have something in line with OAIS )

Link to OAIS reference architecture: http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0b1.pdf
by the way, a point that may be worth emphasizing for the review is the extent that we adhere to the archive and curation micro-service idea in order t ouse small modular services in order to be able to scale further. This is in comparision to a large, all encompassing single system that risks being found to be rigid in architectural composition and/or scalability.

Also, just for completeness, the DataONE architeture noodled out bhy the CCIT can be found by drilling down in the repo starting at 
https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/cicore/architecture/



  * HW, SW development and implementation timeline (Gantt chart, key deliverables, products)

Randy suggests that the document outline be organized along the functionality provided by the infrastructure, and then the crosscutting services provided by functionality. Talk about the problems we're working on, not the technology we're building.

Here's a restated document outline just before lunch:

3. Functions implemented by dataONE architecture
3.1 curation and preservation
    - (many of the desing choices fall under this category)
    - LOCKSS approach
    - Persistent identifier framework
3.2 Search and discovery
    - impoved access and discoverability of data / resources
3.4 Privacy and access control on a national/global scale
3.5 Integration with investigator tools
    - Supporting the full data life cycle

4. Collaborations
4.1 DataONE and Data Conservancy
4.2 Teragrid
4.3 Filtered Push

NSF: here's what the reviewers will look at during the review:
Vision
Milestones
Delivery and timeframes
- science / community engagement
- technical detail
- prototype demo

--> Dave V., Bruce W, and Matt J will develop the full TOC
--> CCIT Review the TOC, at a minimum and welcome to contribute more

  * Security
  * Technical sustainability
  * Deployment
  * Curation and Preservation
  * Policies, SLAs
  * Metrics, assessment/feedback
  * Collaborations
  * DataONE-Data Conservancy coordination
  * TeraGrid
  * Filtered Push
  * Investigator Toolkit
  * Working Group Activities - work this into the dialog

  * Functionality implemented by the architecture - table form, prehaps in appendix
  Capture the mapping between products, design goals, a
    - CNs
    - MNs
    - ITK
  




Use existing system diagrams and architecture documents. Should also ensure we reference and present DataONE in terms such as those used by OAIS.
--> High level reference architecture diagram
--> Bruce W will do diagrams, following ESDIS 


NSF comments: it's difficult to find knowledgeable reviews, so care in phrasing of our project is important to make it easier for less-knowledgeable reviewers provide a fair review. 
NSF Perspective - this document must speak to an audience that may not have the technical expertise that we have.  Half of our review panel may not have expertise, so we need to phrase this document so that it can be read and understood by reviewers who don't have the technical expertise (highly qualified but in different subject areas).

Must hook the reviewers with the 5 pages of the exective summary.

---------- 

Notes past here


* Implementing authentication, authorization, and identity management (two
  blocks), focus on prototype impl.  Focus on authorization implementation aspects.

* Integrating output from Bertram's group (two blocks)

  - reports from each technical working groups
  - helping other working groups getting started
  - synopsis from joint wg on semantics (Matt)

* Data modeling and packaging - how to map this into the DataONE data model or adapt / change DataONE to work with more granular models
of data collections

* General update on related topics / projects (perhaps over dinner)

* Investigator Toolkit.  Need to invest time in developing some nicer tools for compelling demonstrations (esp for Feb target)
  - define roadmap for prioritizing apps / tools for integration

* User interface for data discovery, search and delivery
  - semantic search topics 

* (related to delivery above) Integration / working nicely with existing systems.  For example EML URLs point to some data set - how to take those URLS and make them
behave as identifiers in the DataONE context
