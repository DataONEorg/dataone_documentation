Notes for Sprint 2013.6-Block.1.3
=================================


Robert
------
 * 20130227
   * CN approval tool is working now
     * tried to enable it to work not just against localhost
     * involves the HazelcastClientFactory, would like to pass in all IPs for a cluster since it needs to connect to the IP running d1-processing
     * however, indexing needs to connect to the specific IP (localhost)
   * Installed approve tool on production
   * UNM LDAP wasn't receiving LDAP syncrepl updates - restarted slapd in sandbox
   * Will be getting back to STAGE2 buildout environment
 * 20130225
   * Testing out approval tool, some VM trouble
   * Started on another task for buildouts, make them more transparent, add in a localnetwork option
   * Will use Sandbox for approval tool testing
 * 20130222
   * Discussed Dryad issues with Ryan
     * identifiers are not coming through with unique timestamps
     * wrote an email to address this
     * will use sandbox for Dryad testing
     * sent them the test certificate
 * 20130220
   * reviewing dev env for Dryad
   * possible reinstall / update of MNs in dev environment
   * Will run as single MN in dev
   * Need to update all environments to current released version dev, stage-1, and sandbox
   * Will spend a little time on the node registration tool
   * Will need to a deployment of 1.1.2 to production if Dryad is to be in production
   * issue is java upgrades with bouncycastle security dependency. Currently, we control java upgrades so it is less of an issue, but when we upgrade to OpenJDK Java 7, we will be able to receive auto-upgrades from Ubuntu.
 * 20130218
   * sync'd ORC objects synchronized in production, index update as best as possible
     * can add to RR
   * Will roll out ONEMercury in production with Skye, Chris
   * Will look at cn-stage-orc-1 ServiceFailure
   * Working on task where SystemMetadata are equivalent across CNs (content)
     * Working on a script for this
 * 20130213
   * cn-stage-2 env is back up - sync was not working properly
     * re-sync'd, all looks good
   * Working on stats from the CNs
     * 99% of GETs came from 4 IPs
     * KNB got > 1M hits in 7 months? Is this realistic
     * Need logs from 
       * LTER: Mark Servilla- Robert will contact Mark with sql script
       * PISCO: Mike Frenock - Ben will contact
       * [DONE] ESA, SANParks: Ben will run these queries
       * CDL, ONEShare: Mark Reyes - Robert will run Log
       * ORNLDAAC, USGSCSAS: Giri - Robert will run Log
       * CLOAKN: Robert will run Log. CLOAKN is misconfigured contacting Kevin Webb
 * 20130211
   * cn-unm-1 is upgraded and in the process of being re-indexed.
   * will query CN's to discover read count
   * Upgrade of the cn stage 2 environment
     * cn-stage-unm-2.test.dataone.org should be wiped and rebuilt. 
     * cn-stage-orc-2.test.dataone.org will be added to cluster and will replicate content when it is ready(dependent upon a travelling Matt amd certificates)
     * keep replication off until Chris gets MNs sorted out
   * Will work on log statistics for Dave
   * Will reinstall cn-stage-unm-2, scrub, and re-sync

   * Working on enabling ServiceMethodRestrictions in Metacat
     * Updating ServiceMethodRestrictions for production replica targets
     * Still trying to decide what the white list of subjects will be since the node list of potential source nodes is dynamic. May just need to hard code the list and periodically update it as MNs are approved

     * Ryan said that, for now (the RSV), an updated science metadata document at /object/{pid?ver=timestamp} will continue to return bytes from /object/{pid} since they are not persisting the previous version. He plans to change this, but not by the RSV
   * Updated watchazel to Hazelcast 2.4.1 for replication monitoring. Installed in stage2, working fine
   * Coordination for the CLOAKN to EBIRD + AKN member nodes.  Probably should discuss this a bit

DRYAD Implementation Issues
===========================


We found that the DataONE Identifier (DOI + timestamp) string was not used consistently.

1) Timestamp is missing from <identifier> in the systemMetadata documents:

 * http://dev.datadryad.org/mn/v1/meta/http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.12?ver=2011-08-02T16:00:05.530-0400
 * The <identifier> element only has http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.12, while it should have http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.12?ver=2011-08-02T16:00:05.530-0400.

2) the BaseUrl of the node xml found at http://dev.datadryad.org/mn/node  should be https://dev.datadryad.org/mn instead of https://dev/datadryad.org/mn

3) listObjects() "count" parameter is not respected: http://dev.datadryad.org/mn/v1/object?count=0 (returns 20 objects)

4) Checksums on the ORE documents change 
        Maybe just for this record? Reproducible on other ORE docs?
    For example: 
        http://dev.datadryad.org/mn/v1/meta/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.5061%2Fdryad.12%3Fformat%3Dd1rem%26ver%3D2011-08-02T16%3A00%3A05.530-0400
        
        Alternates between:
            <checksum algorithm="MD5">8ce9e5ea2efd775a81ed5eaf54e92928</checksum>
            <checksum algorithm="MD5">32fb6ab675112f3537055b37f874353</checksum>

5) the identifier, checksum and formatId in the object list is different than found in the SystemMetadata when a getSystemMetadata (/meta) call is performed

6) [OPTIONAL] We recommend that in the DryadDataPackage and DryadDataFile DC xml dcterms:hasPart, dcterms:isPartOf and dcterms:identifier should use the DataONE PID (i.e., the DOI + timestamp construct).  But, since the content of the SciMetadata will not impact DataONE, other than for indexing, those values could be anything reasonable.
