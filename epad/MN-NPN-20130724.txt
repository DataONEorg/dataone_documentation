Agenda:
    Introductions
        Laura -  MN coordinator for DataONE (UTK)
        Alyssa - AD/IT coordinator for USA-NPN  (sit in Tuscon, AZ)
        Lee - s/w developer for USA-NPN (sit in Tucson, AZ)
        John - MN coordinator for DataONE (ORNL)
        
    Where we are now
        Lee: went to DataONE workshop 9/2011, learned about s/w stack for metacat instance, etc.; things seem to be working well, but don't have an LDAP server set up yet (authentication service)
        John: new version of metacat came online with ability to publish out of metacat an interface that will work with DataONE API
        Lee: in 2011 it looked difficult but in the past couple weeks Lee was able to install and it worked very nicely
        John: see IRC  http://irc.ecoinformatics.org/  
        Lee: plan is to get an LDAP system installed  ?? do we need a CILogon to work with this??
        John: needs to be authentication between node and D1 CN, D1 issues an authentication ticket to recognize/validate MN
        Discussion of tiers:
       * Tier 1: read only  (NPN thinks this is where they wish to operate)
       * Tier 2: authentication needed (needs sign-in of some sort - see CILogon)  D1 created an interoperable authentication/logon mechanism
       * Tier 3: willing to allow replication of my data at another MN
       * Tier 4: willing to host replication from other MNs
        Lee: when was decision made to go from original design to tiered concept
        John: it's been a long time, version 1 of DataONE (released last July 2012) has the tiered concept
        Alyssa: we think we want to operate at tier 1
        John: another question - what data do you want to publish? 
       * decide what data to publish
       * create persistent identifiers (DOIs)
       * metadata
        Alyssa: we think we'll have one dataset that's historic wildlife data, others by year
        Lee: DOIs, option to use generated numbers as long as they're unique
        John: yes, we're trying to create long-term archives with immutable, persistent identifiers
        Lee: I think there are organizations that create PIDs, Bruce knows about this
        Alyssa: we'll work on PIDs/DOIs with Bruce
        Lee: "live" data with data submitted by citizen scientists (i.e. Nature's Notebook)
        John: decide when to publish the data - yearly? monthly?  and how to package it.   DataONE recognizes this issue in more than one MNs operations
        
        John: with streaming data or frequently updated data, can have the "latest and greatest" data with a given DOI, recognizing that the contents of that DOI
        
        We looked at the flowchart:
        http://mule1.dataone.org/OperationDocs/member_node_deployment/mn_checklist.html
        
        We're in the Develop phase: establish a test system
        John: <a good discussion of the testing process>  first test phase is more of a "are you alive?" (heartbeat), next steps look at data/metadata, etc.; then staging (make sure everything is "pretty" before we go production);  
        ACTION:  John to send "welcome" email to Alyssa, Lee
                
        Laura:  it appears that we are at the "establish a test system" step
        
        Alyssa: due date (as in redmine) of 10/31/13 seems reasonable 
        
        John: probably need to set a follow-up meeting to ensure that Lee has everything he needs to move forward
        ACTION:  Laura to check Dave and/or Ben for availability
        
    Next steps
        ACTION:  John to send "welcome" email to Alyssa, Lee: Complete
        ACTION:  Laura to check Dave and/or Ben for availability for follow-up meeting
        Laura to send MNF info to Alyssa and Lee
        Laura to send summary email related to "welcome" letter to all involved
