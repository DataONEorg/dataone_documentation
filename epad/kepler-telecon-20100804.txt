Participants
-----------------
Jones, Altintas, Ludaescher, McPhillips

Discussion items
--------------------------
0. Kepler 2.1
    -- https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/build/kepler-2.1-release-roadmap
    -- reviewed tasks for 2.1, no major changes other than the issue of time estimates
    -- will try to get devs to enter time spent and time remaining on each task for 2.1

1. Where do we tell other contributors to publish modules?
    -- contributors in poland that have modules
    -- some people might have their own license
    -- see new feature request for 2.2

2. Save workflows as kar vs. add module info in xml
    -- save as kar is easiest course in GUI, save only saves as KAR
    -- still need to be easy to use bare xml files, both at command line and GUI -- open menu allows opening both xml and kar files
    -- commandline still supports both xml and kar
    
3. Kepler 2.2
    -- should add new list of repositories for MM to search, or alternate way for MM to load 3rd party modules from outside Kepler repository (target Kepler 2.2)
    -- rest of discussion on 2.2 delayed until next week
