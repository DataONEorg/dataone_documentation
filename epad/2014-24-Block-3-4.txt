     * Refactor CN components to use new d1_common_java changes
     * Schedule Meeting to determine the scope of changes to apply or add. (review empty vs null List/Map variables in JibX)
   * Incorporate HTTPClient 4.2 into libclient (affects CN stack - focus on testing affected components)
   * Replication Auditing w/splunk logging

 * Important: Add a maven.dataone.org repository


Skye
----

Rob
---
 * 20140609
   * Testing new d1_libclient_java - refactoring d1_integration to use refactored libclient classes/interfaces
 * 20140611
   * participated in mutability discussion
   * d1_libclient_java: cleaning up interfaces, and writing a test MNode implementation that doesn't use HttpClient to test the new design.  Hope to be able to use it in testing SeriesID discussions.
   * EDAC support:  EDAC changes the default page size to 20, and synchronization harvested items, though only 1032 are shown in the SOLR query, while EDAC reports a total of 1075 via listObjects.
 * 20140613
   * EDAC: 18 FGDC metadata docs are not syncing due to invalid formatting.  Should this delay the announcement?
   * libclient refactor - debugging and testing.  Things a bit slow with the NodeLocator implementations / factories.  Have successfully run MN Tier tests against real MNs.
 * 201406016
   * EDAC: working through emerging performance issue - node seems to be intermittantly down a lot.  Discussed with Chris that the best thing to do is to inform leadership (Karl, Rebecca, Dave) as to it's impact. 
   * libclient refactor: low-level connection management bug fix.
   * d1_integration: fixed unclear error message as related to listObject count test.  New MNTier1 test "stressTest" to identify performance issues early.
 * 20140620
   * series ID discussions
     * Q. about d1_common_java & libclient_java preparedness for v2:  Any design work done?
   * libclient refactor:  
     * want to define common methods (get, ping, etc.) as an interface in d1_common_java for better handling of general client-side implementations (e.g. pagedListObjects)
     * noticed provenance-related features being added to ResourceMapFactory without discussion or tickets in redmine.
 * 20140702
   * libclient refactor: finished NodeLocator implementation and wiring mechanism for use of Mock objects working.  Sent overview to Skye for code review. 
   * iRODS support: helping Lisa (along with Chris) on Tomcat configuration.
   * participating in V2 design discussions.

David D
-------
 * 20140711
   * Migrated cn-stage-orc-2 to new VM HW
     * took about 7 hours, confirming duration from cn-stage-orc-1
     * had to reconfigure network configuration, as old configs were incorrect and led to lack of network connectivity after migration
     * waiting on 1.2.8 to move prod
   * I don't have a name for my successor yet, but I have contact info for the team lead, so I'm gathering infrastructure documentation to send his way
   * Working on Splunk indexer cluster build
     * Off-site VMs? sending VM specs to cjones/vieglais
 * 20140709
   * Migrated cn-stage-orc-1 to new VM HW to test
     * migration took several hours more than expected - hoping to migrate cn-stage-orc-2 today this week to confirm
   * Splunk cluster VMs have dataone.org DNS entries, so index replication testing is now properly in progress
   * Meeting w/Bruce tomorrow, hopefully should have some contact info for new ORC sysadmin
 * 20140707
   * Ready to begin VM migration (prod, stage, others as requested) to new hosts
     * Will require brief downtime, need to coordinate that
   * Built several VMs at ORC to test Splunk index replication
     * need to get .dataone.org names for 3 ORC VMs
 * 20140702
   * VM hardware tests
   * Splunk
     * building test cluster peer, testing index clustering
     * updating all Splunk agents to v6.1.2
 * 20140630
   * Testing new VM hardware before migration of existing VMs to new hardware, working w/OIT to get issues with access to new hardware ironed out
   * Looking into converting Splunk setup to cluster-based indexing to provide redundancy of indexes and protection against hardware failure
     * Build a second test indexer at ORC to test behavior
     * Ideally, will have at least one indexer offsite either at UCSB or UNM to protect against catastrophic failure at ORC
   * Looking into cn-orc-1 failure from a couple of weeks back
     * Have some interesting error messages, would like to go over them with someone from coredev to see if they tell us anything more than we already know
 * 20140618
   * Worked with Skye on getting CN audit logs into Hazelcast and getting his account working
     * Built inputs for that into all CNs to get that ready for future rollouts
   * Finishing up deployment server work
   * Found an issue w/rsyslog on 12.04 - message rate limiting in place by default
   * Looked into building hazelcast alert that Chris asked about Monday
 * 20140616
   * Splunk deployment server:
     * all CNs/MNs are pulling inputs configurations from deployment server
     * Splunk indexer pulling all app configurations from deployment server
     * TO DO: output configurations on CNs/MNs, inputs/outputs on site forwarders, inputs on indexer, document
   * MAYBE DEFINITELY TO DO: test CN audit log aggregation into Splunk w/Skye
 * 20140613
   * Splunk deployment server: all Splunk instances are polling the server for updates, downloading a test app, installing and configuring as expected
   * Need to build further apps and configuration files into deployment server, map to server categories, and deploy
   * Checking w/Skye to see if CN audit logging is ready for Splunk, if so, testing on dev
   * Helped Jing w/a DNS error on mn-sandbox-orc-1 Wednesday evening
 * 20140609
   * Went over preliminary CN audit Splunk logging work w/Skye
     * Skye is working on (has finished?) log implementation
     * I built CN audit indexes into Splunk
     * When dev environment is ready after OS upgrades, will work on building inputs into Splunk and testing
   * SSL vulnerability fix on ORC VMs
     * Went through all ORC VMs and checked openssl versions, upgraded as necessary
Peter
-----
 * 20140609
   * out 1.5 days last week
   * log agg 'refactored' code to reduce hazelcast dependency is ready for testing
   * implementing ./cn/v1/query/logsolr endpoint
     * query engine description
     * this endpoint will be implemented via apache jk connector and not through Spring DispatcherServlet 
       * this is the same mechanism that ./cn/v1/query/solr uses

            -------
            15048
            (1 row)
         the number of smreplicationstatus should be 
         15048+ 5077(total objects (this is for orginal node))+ 5055(sci metadata in cn) + N (number of ORE on CN) =25180

       * Ensure all MNs are listed in the MN list search box (worked)
       * Try both scimeta and scidata downloads (download doesn't work, it opens another tab (resolve) and hangs there)
       * Look at both eml and fgdc rendering (spot check manual)(worked)
         * did a % sesarch, click "view metaca" and get org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Request processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 7        org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:583)
         * Production cn has the same issue.

     * Metacat & hz repl - scimeta and scidata (object_format_list*) content is replicated across CNs (working)
       * /object?count=0  should be the same on all 3 CNs ( 3 cns has the same number 5073) (Worked)
       * /var/metacat/{documents|data} should have the same count (worked)
         * ucsb has 17 resource objects, 5035 scimeta documents (total 5052)

         * are jobs scheduled for each MN (looking at the log file) when d1-processing daemon starts.(worked)
         * after each MN is harvested, perform a count (always from day ago): on the cn perform a solr query using curl, on mn perform log query (with dates)
           * For CCI 1.2.7, Solr endpoint will be /solr/..., for CCI 1.3.0 it will be /cn/v1/query/logsolr/...

gives the error:
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
