Agenda
1) Status of registration
 * 32 have registered so far (usually about 40 to 50 are at the meeting usually), half are DataONE internal
 * expected more registration this year w/ DMPTool and more focus, anticipating more registrations and walk-ins
 * hotel registration rate ends on June 5, need to fill them for various reasons
 * composition of registrations so far
   * quite a few librarians, some industry, academia, government
   * largest group is librarians, then program managers, then data managers
   * all say they are coming Monday, many not on Sunday
   * some of the non-DataONE people are new, some are repeats
   * several are from Boulder, Denver
   * don't see any outside of US
 * need to aggressively increase registration between now and Thursday!
   * DMPTool workshop may help with this, posting/announcing a bit late
   * emphasis on administrators and users should be an important thing
 * only 5 have expressed interest in posters so far
 * long weekend seems to be a problem
   * must cover at least 59 rooms per night ---- need at least twice as many people to register as what we have now
