Agenda for 2013-08-23

1.  Review of Year 5 plans of Working Groups (based on input from WG co-leads)

Provenance WG
Milestones Summary:
 * ProvWG related presentations/posters at 
   * DataONE AHM (PBase summer internship, ongoing research on querying provenance)
   * CAMP-4-DATA 
   * AGU 
   * TDWG
 * Initial demo/prototype of provenance-aware R 
 * Finalizing D-PROV model (technical report,  paper)
 * Further integration of provenance tools with the DataONE CI
 * Explore funding opportunities to continue/expand ProvWG work

Milestones (Details)
Short term:
We aim to present two posters at the Oct. 2013 DataONE AHM, detailing:
 * The   outcomes of our summer internship. Parisa’s work has focused on   implementing PBase on top of the Neo4J graph DBMS. The implementation   includes the key provenance queries that were identified during our  June  WG meeting, as well as importers for VisTrails provenance traces.
 * Progress   on research from Victor Cuevas. Victor has been focusing on the   performance of our PBase provenance management platform, on two fronts.   Firstly, he has been experimenting with indexing structures that are   optimised for querying graph data. Secondly, he has been analysing the   scalability limitations of the Neo4J graph DBMS, which is currently our   choice of Data Layer for PBase. The aim of this work is to ensure that   PBase can fit in with the scale requirements of the broader DataONE   architecture.

Until July, 2014:

 * We   aim to continue research on scalable provenance queries, possibly   considering alternatives to the current Neo4J DBMS. This includes a   benchmarking effort.
   * Starting point: Victor’s current work
   * Expected   outcomes: a technical report and possibly a publication on what we   learned from implementing experimental indexing and benchmarking Neo4J,   focusing on opportunities to optimize performance for   provenance-specific graphs and queries
 * Making R provenance-aware
   * Starting point: blueprints from earlier discussions involving Karthik, James Cheney, Paolo
   * Expected   outcomes: A proof-of concept prototype, depending on available   resources. Duncan Temple Lang is deeply involved in R development and   would be ideal to lead this effort.
 * Finalizing the D-PROV model
   * Starting point: the white paper prepared over the summer for the July planning meeting
   * Expected outcomes: 
     * technical report and/or full paper (journal)
     * A white paper on the added value from provenance in the broad context of data preservation. 
 * Further integration of PBase and other provenance tools with the DataONE architecture
   * Starting point: the prototype and demo code developed in 2012 for the NSF RSV.
   * Expected outcome: a richer prototype that is based on PBase and includes additional importers from workflow traces.

Life of our codebase after DataONE phase 1
We   would like to discuss options to make our codebase available to  research groups affiliated with the Prov WG after the end of the  group’s  activities. Both UC Davis and Newcastle have expressed interest  in using PBase and it associated code to pursue further experimenting  and  research.

EVA WG
Milestones for next 12 months:
October 2013

========================================================================
Semantics and Integration WG

Milestones for next 12 months: 
  
--           Demonstrate how the SemantEco Annotator, developed over the DataONE summer intership, can be used to integrate wildfire and water quality data and/or other datasets of types important to DataONE;  the updated wildfire use case is described at:   https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/integration-and-semantics/products/use-cases/HydroEco-Use-Case-selected-events-wildfires.docx/view.  Initial demonstration available in Oct 2013.
      
--           Demonstrate the value of linked data and ontologies for integration and discovery in the use case with a write-up submission to an appropriate conference.
--           Refine and demonstrate a prototype data discovery interface that suggests keywords to users for query expansion based on vocabulary and topic modeled terms as described in the DataONE Newsletter. 
--           Work with the DataONE CCIT to transition prototypes, tools and techniques developed by the Integration and Semantics Working Group into the DataONE infrastructure.  We will also identify and gather additional requirements that may affect our ongoing work.
--           Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) NSF project  leveraging post doctoral work on ontology and infrastructure.  Work continues with SONet PI /DataONE wg member Schildhauer, SONet co-PI/ DataONE wg co-lead McGuinness, DataONE postdoc Seyed, SONet postdoc, and LTER/dataone member O’Brien.
      --         Face to Face meetings.  We plan to provide an update on the work of our group at the upcoming All Hands Meeting, including a DataONE Summer Intern presentation on the annotator work along with future directions.  We plan to have at least one additional face-to-face meeting of the working group.
      Presentations include International Semantic Web Conference, AGU, and possibly TDWG

=======================================================================
PPSR WG
Note from RK: Rick and Greg working on adding dates

Milestones for the next 12 months:
 
   * Widely  disseminate to the PPSR field our two new data guides: The Guide to  Managing Data in PPSR projects described in the last report and our new  Guide to Data Policies for PPSR Projects written by our summer intern,  Anne Bowser
   * Translate both guides into interactive web formats for use on www.citizenscience.org 
   * Publish an academic paper based on the Data Policies Guide 
   * Submit  a revised paper on models for the collection of field-based citizen  science observational data with colleagues at U of Minn computer science  department (Wiggins)
   * Continue  working on developing a core data exchange standard for the sharing of  PPSR related data and associated datasets. This data exchange protocol  (PPSR_CORE) will define core data fields and formats related to PPSR  programs. It will identify required data fields and formats along with  optional fields. The standard will be delivered and supported as both a  JSON-based and an XML-based protocol to facilitate third party data  provider Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) development to  seamlessly share and exchange PPSR data and metadata. It is envisioned  that PPSR_CORE will be used by RESTful web services to consume and share  data about PPSR programs and data generated by PPSR programs. The  proposed PPSR_CORE protocol will form the basis of the newly developed  CitizenScience.org web application and database that will facilitate  searching of PPSR programs and associated datasets. Finally, the  protocol will also facilitate data exchange and sharing with DataONE  member nodes and will lead to the easy development of third party data  provider web services to make it easier for PPSR programs to contribute  data to DataONE member nodes.
   * Continue  developing the outline and data-collection validation for a large-scale  research project/paper that will be based, in part, from data generated  by deployment of the above-mentioned data exchange protocol (DUST; Data  Usage Study)
   * Continue  work on a major paper on Guidelines for Effective Data Management  targeted toward potential program managers, data managers, data users,  and the broad scientific community
   * Complete  (with several individuals external to the WG) a manuscript for an  upcoming issue of Issues in Ecology focused on conservation/policy  outcomes of PPSR
