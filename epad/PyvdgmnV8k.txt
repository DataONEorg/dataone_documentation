Participants:  Jeanne Behnke, Dave Meyer, Rama Ramapriyan, Tom Sohre, and Bob Cook

Agenda 

1.  Scheduling the MEaSUREs Review: availability of key participants.

**** 
It appears March is becoming problematic, although I understand the last week may still be an option. 
**** 

Note that most of the data were collected back in September; we may need to re-poll, especially Woody, Diane, and Martha

 * Kamel would prefer February, but is generally available late-Feb through early April. 

 * David Roy has conflicts from Feb 16-28, March 1-4 and  April 6-20; mid- to late-March works best for him. 

 * Dave would like to avoid March 7 - 11

 * Bob would like to avoid March 14 -18

 * George Hurtt cannot make it on March 21 - 25.

 * Rama expressed a desire to avoid late Feb . More specifically - March 4 thorugh 7.

 * Tom is unavailable the week of April 11-15.
 * Dave is unavailable April 4-14


tenatively March 29 (MEaSUREs), March 30-31 (joint UWG)

Action:  Jeanne to check on availability of Diane, Martha, and Woody for these dates.

3.  Pre-review schedule of activities. 

Both WELD and VIP clients are ready, although Kamel's products are still in development. 
 
VIP ATBD review: 

 * Make Didan’s ATBD’s available for algorithm peer review, 
 * Conduct peer review of ATBD’s (Wickland).  Internal to NASA
 * QUESTION: should the LP DAAC (or ORNL) be assisting with the ATDB review in any way? 

VIP, WELD MEaSURES Peer Reviews (March 29) : 

 * Make Didan’s sample products and documentation available for review (Didan/LP DAAC) 
 * Make Roy’s sample products and documentation available for review (Roy/LP DAAC) 
 * NOTE – documentation in above two bullets is in addition to ATBD’s and focuses on things users would need to understand and use the products 

Action:  Dave to determine documents and Web resources (client URLS) need to be made avaiable for review teams. LP has web links for reviewer access to ESDRs and supporting documentation. ready as soon as we're cleared to open them. 


Action:  Martha/Rama to provide to Kamel and David recommended outline of review sesson 

Action:  Bob & Dave to work with Jeanne via email to develop an agenda for the 2-day joint UWG meeting.   First step is to develop a straw man agenda and provide common threads. May want to develop common subcommittees for LP and ORNL UWG members.

Action:  Dave, Bob & Rama set up a pre-meeting telecon with all participants for final planning (timing? one month before? two?)
