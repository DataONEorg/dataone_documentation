Agenda for 2013-04-19

1) CI Update (Vieglais - traveling so report by email)


CI activities for the last week,

- the usual maintenance and progression through minor issues

- reviewing draft for supporting mutable content through series  identifiers. SIDs are optional identifiers that can be assigned to the  family of objects the conceptually refer to the same thing (e.g. a  series of revisions to a metadata document), and by default, the SID  will refer to the latest revision of the series. CCIT discussion on the  matter scheduled for Monday
{http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/design/ContentMutability.html}

- working on replication auditing services that check the number of  replicas for an object, verifies the availability of those replicas, and  balances the replicas as necessary

- Discussion about object packaging and how best to represent as  internal structures within the various tools, in the search results  pages, and the best mechanisms for serializing all objects in a package  to be downloaded. BagIt is considered the most viable standard solution  for constructing downloadable packages. There is some concern over  conflict with this recommendation and existing approaches that might be  employed by MNs.

- SEAD MN in staging. The MN is technically ready for production,  however before moving to production, a broader evaluation of the content  available should be performed, and there are some related activities to  be performed on the SEAD side of the implementation. e.g. there is  currently only a small subset of total content available in the staging  node.

- Semantics WG meeting this week identified several goals for short and  mid-term activities. Short-term goals involve evaluation of topic maps  as a mechanism for high level grouping of content and as a possible  approach to assist with keyword normalization, term expansion in query  construction, and possible guidance in high level aspects of ontology  development as it relates to the diverse content in DataONE.

Matt adds:  The Taiwan Forestry Research Institute (TFRI) node has been tested in Stage and its looking good.  We discovered some bugs in handling of Chinese language characters in ONEMercury, and Skye is working on fixing those.  TFRI is starting the production install, and will register and wait for us to fix the Chinese character encoding issues in ONEMercury.

2) CEE Update  (Budden)
Pat L  (USFW) - they are building requirements for informatics for agency; training and education materials are further down the road. Amber put him in contact with Mike Frame and Karl Benedict for help with the informatics portion.

AGU proposals for sessions

ESA is dedicating time for demos - DataONE has signed up to this.
DMPTool - Sloan and IMLS funding for the DMPTool. CDL is interviewing developers for the Sloan funding. Hoping to have hires in place by next month. Research Advisory Board and Administrators Advisory Board

3) Update on EUDAT/DataONE meeting (Koskela)

Areas for possible collaboration:
-          Having nodes for replication for testing/prototyping
     * So having a D1 member-node in the EUDAT framework
     * Perhaps having an iRODS node in D1
-          Metadata exchange
-          Convince Dave to participate in DFT WG in RDA
-          Unifying site/node registry
-          Exchange of educational/training material
-          Make use of BP Primer
-          Exchange about DMP tool (will connect them with Andrew Sallans)

4) Around the Room (if time)

Deborah  (I will be in transit during this meeting):
-  Data Integration and Semantics Working group had a Face to Face meeting  at NCEAS from Tuesday - Thursday (with some preparation meetings  before).  CCIT members Vieglas and Leinfelder joined us for portions as  did postdoc Stacy Rebich Hespanha and postdoc Ben Adams for portions
- The group refined summer internship plans, semantic search plans, and our driving hydro-eco use case descriptions
- Postdoc Seyed provided an overview of the Semantics working group for EUDAT/DataONE meeting
- McGuinness provided an introduction to Web Science and Semantic Data integration for the Women in Science "Red Chair" series

Bertram:  ProvWG meeting planned for June 24&25 at NYU Poly. Bertram gave an  overview on ProvWG at EUDAT/DataONE meeting. Victor Cuevas and Saumen  Dey attended NorCal Database day at Stanford.

Bruce: Regrets.  Will not be able to attend.  Have interviewed and made a verbal offer to a grad student for CI for next year, and I have a verbal acceptance.  Will work to get this official in the next week. Spent some time working on the UTK institutional repository description effort.

Suzie: Mike and I will be meeting with Andrew Sallans this afternoon. He was visiting the UT library to talk about research data.  We have the IRB and final permission from FigShare community so that survey is in the field as of yesterday.

Working Group:  Data Integration and Semantics
Co-chairs: Deborah McGuinness, Jeff Horsburgh
Overall Objective: The mission of the Integration and Semantics Working Group is to guide the specification, adoption, and implementation of semantics technologies, broadly defined, which will enable DataONE to sustainably achieve its objectives for the seamless discovery, integration, and dissemination of Earth observational data.

Milestones for next 12 months:
 * Work with Dave Vieglas (CCIT) for testing the performance of search with and without the additional knowledge structures we are developing.
 * Additional future work includes leveraging DataONE’s metadata environment, for example accessing eBird metadata and data through DataONE mechanisms, when available.
 * Update a set of tasks and a mentorship plan for the Post-Doctoral scholar, Patrice Seyed, to correspond with the goals and objectives of the working group.  The initial task is focused on leveraging one or more of the semantic tools and infrastructure at RPI on DataOne data.  
 * Examine the DataONE ONEDrive protototype and provide recommendations for how semantics could be used to improve the organizational/folder structure.
 * Continue to develop and refine use cases to drive our work.  Our initial interdisciplinary use case leverages expertise from group members around hydrology and ecology.  It is available at: https://docs.dataone.org/member-area/working-groups/integration-and-semantics/products/use-cases/Data-Integration-and-Semantics-Working-Group-HydroEco-Use-Case-Draft.docx/view.  This use case also has been created to demonstrate the need for and show how semantic technologies can enhance data discovery and integration.
 * Continue interactions with the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) group working toward specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data.  Work has begun on this effort including discussions among members Seyed, Schildhauer, McGuinness and SONet and DataONE member from SBC LTER O'Brien and the new SONet postdoc.
     * Face to face meetings will include a meeting at the 2013 all hands meeting as well as one other meeting to be planned.

 * Held successful face-to-face working group meeting at NCEAS
   * Refinements to the Hydro-Eco Use case. 
   * Patrice Seyed (postdoctoral  fellow) has been leading the development of  the Hydro-Eco use case infrastructure and supporting ontologies, which now supports  multi-domain environment quality data (water, air), exploring and  visualizing species data (i.e., bird data from eBird, fish data from  SBC-LTER) simultaneously with environment data, and dynamic hierarchical  faceted exploration of chemicals (e.g., Arsenic) and species (e.g.,  Rock Eagle Owl) for enhanced searching capabilities.
