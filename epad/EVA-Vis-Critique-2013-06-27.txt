2.  2 examples of how visualizations can be improved - Aritra
Set of slides

3.  Plan and Schedule

Plan for the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) Paper   
1.  Taxonomy of design problems developed from 100 to 200 images from TBM community
        have evaluated 106, need another 100 or so images:  check with Steve A., Forrest, and Bill Hargrove (map curves?).
        Bill: More thoughts on conception nature of comparison
        Enrico: Visualization used for communication and exploration purposes
        
            who:  Aritra and Jorge with Claudio and Enrico
            methododolgy: partially described in Sect 2.1  of the vis paper??? 
                using general design principles to evaluate the images
                 expand Sect 2.1 to fully describe the method for applying general vis  design principles and how they were used to evaluate the images
                
                Talk with Anna and Forrest  and ??? to get more images
                 Compile a database of images with: intent, problem description, recommendations, communications between us and scientists
                
2.  Need to have 5 or so figures of a diversity of types derived from the Taxonomy of Design Problems (Step #1 above)
            include complexity of the image as a contributor to the diversity

3.  Identify the problems and redo the images with our solutions 
    already have re-done two images (from March Vis paper)

4.  Discuss the problems and the re-done figures 
                    with the EVA group
                    
5.   survey the community to see if those improvements are suitable
                 how do we plan to present this in the manuscript? make a plan, which will guide our discussion with scientists and usability survey         

6.  develop guidelines / conclusions 
            state general visualization design principles
            present best practices originating from this paper
            include some info about good images found during the initial steps (Step 1 above)

The InfoVis paper plus reviews will be a good starting point for the TVCG paper.

Schedule
The schedule that we discussed for completing this paper was basically a couple of months July and August to do the main work and prepare a draft and a month September to do a careful internal review of the paper.

4.  Discussion

Steve: keep activities well bounded, climate scientists; next phase (after successful completion of this activity) consider working with managers (eg, land managers); third phase perhaps consider conveying this type of information to decision makers

Actions: 
1). New image examples to be collected: Bill, Steve, Anna, Christopher, Forrest, ...
2). Compile a document of current images with our (e.g. Aritra's) understanding of the messages that authors wanted to convey and share within this EVA group. Allow anyone to comment and provide feedbacks.

5.  Next call

    Steve: Monday 11-12, Wednesday 10-12, Friday 11-12, Mountain time <g>
    Bill H.:  I'm out on *vacation* all week, sorry.  Could possibly phone in though ...

6.  Next Face to Face Meeting
    September?
    Venue?  Oak Ridge
                    Bay area
                    Boulder?
                    other
    Claudio: end of september
    Anna:  first week of Sept will be away
    Steve: generally open in sept
    Bill: Sept 26-29 will be away
    Christopher: teaching a lot in Sept, but may work (I need to be in FLG the week of 16-18 for sure).
