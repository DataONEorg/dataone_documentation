Paragraph:

ArXiv

ArXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for 884,670 e-prints in specific  scientific disciplines (physics, mathematics,  computer science, nonlinear sciences,  quantitative biology and  statistics). arXiv submissions are intended to be available in perpetuity.  It was founded in 1991.  It does not hold data.  It is funded 3 ways:  1) Cornell University Library, 2) Simons Foundation, 3) global collective of Member institutions.  Total annual operating budget is less than 900K.  

 Access to content via arXiv.org is free to individual end users.  Membership in arXiv and representation on the Membership Advisory Board is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and foundations that contribute to the financial support of the service. Each member institution pledges a five-year initial funding commitment to support arXiv.  

ArXiv has developed both a sustainability plan and an exit strategy concerning loss of funds:  if members’ financial support falls below the level Cornell deems adequate to maintain arXiv at an acceptable level of quality, reserve funds will be used for two years to allow time for Cornell to secure sufficient funding support. Failure to do so may result in the development of an exit strategy, including the transition of arXiv to another institution.  The sustainability advisory group includes representatives from institutions served by arXiv and provides a consultative role in developing diverse sustainability strategies for this critical international resource. 

Cornell University Library  holds the overall responsibility for arXiv’s operation and development, with strategic and operational guidance from its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Staffing is provided by Cornell University Library's Digital Scholarship and Preservation Services unit.

As an electronic archive, arXiv makes a commitment to provide persistent access to all  announced submissions.  arXiv is thus maintained with a focus on the perpetual  availability of submissions.  This is accomplished in part by controlling the types of  files that can be uploaded to arXiv, as well as restricting changes that can be made  after submissions are announced.  In order to preserve the scholarly record, submissions  are not removed from arXiv after they have been announced.

arXiv is proud to be able to offer such a large collection of scholarly work in a single  location, without any fees and with support for users around the world.  arXiv supplements  the traditional publication system by providing immediate dissemination and open access to  scholarly articles (which often later appear in conventional journals).  

arxiv provides geographic redundancy through an international network of mirror repositories.

Funding https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/Initial+Five-Year+Support+Pledges

Cornell University Library (CUL), the Simons  Foundation, and a global collective of institutional  members support arXiv financially. The financial model for 2013-2017 entails  three sources of revenues:
 * CUL provides a cash subsidy of $75,000 per year in support of arXiv's  operational costs and an in-kind contribution of all indirect costs, which  currently represents 37% of total operating expenses.
 * 
 * The Simons Foundation contributes $50,000 per year in recognition of CUL's  stewardship of arXiv. In addition, every year, the Foundation matches $300,000  of the funds generated through arXiv's membership fees.
 * 
 * Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support  arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four  tiers from $1,500-$3,000. Cornell's goal is to raise $300,000 per year through  membership fees generated by approximately 170 institutions. Discounts  for members paying through consortial agreements will be provided. 
We gratefully acknowledge the support of the following institutions for the  arXiv membership model and their intentions for a five-year pledge, 2013-2017.   According to the arXiv's Principles, membership in arXiv and representation on  the MAB is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and  foundations that contribute to the financial support of the service. Please see  the arXiv Sustainability Initiative Website for information about  the arXiv governance and business model. membership in arXiv and representation on the MAB is reserved for libraries,  research institutions, laboratories, and foundations that contribute to the  financial support of the service.
